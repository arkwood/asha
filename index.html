<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/aasimar.jpg]]
Those [[Planetouched]] by [[Elysium]], or on rare instances the coupling between an [[AstraKashira]] and a [[Human]], result in an offspring known as an Aasimar.  While they may be descended from a creature of pure good alignment, and are predisposed to good; Aasimar are by no means always good.  Each Aasimar bears the physical mark of being [[Planetouched]] differently.  Most commonly, they are uncommonly beautiful, averaging slightly taller than a [[Human]].  Other traits that may be expressed are pupil-less pale eyes, silver hair, or pearlescent skin.  In rare cases, one may have small feathers on their back.

!Personality
Many Aasimar grow up cautious around others and, like [[Tieflings|Tiefling]], were sometimes misunderstood, though never to the hateful extend that the [[Tieflings|Tiefling]] were.  Even those raised by understanding parents could not escape their strangeness, or the curiosity (or even fear) that their unique nature sometimes provoked.  Many Aasimar even suffered prejudice, sometimes that deeply hurt their soul.

Adam is a hired guard for [[The Grey Companions]]. He was a former city guard in [[Brand]], joining [[The Grey Companions]] based upon a sense of duty to help them on their mission to protect [[Asha]]. He is honest to a fault, and has an intolerance for [[Darklings|Darkling]].

Abram's father was a carpenter like his father before him.  As a young boy, Abram was raised to understand the skill of carpentry, and even helped build some of the structures within the city of [[Brand]].  When Abram was 15, he and his father traveled to [[Oxam]] for work.  There, his father was contracted to rebuild structures for the [[Darkling]] [[Gang]] known as [[The Family]].  Abram was unaware of the circumstances.  His father knew of their precarious situation, but needed the work and money.  Before their work was complete, an up and coming [[Darkling]] within the [[Gang]] known as [[Darius Kabald]] seized control and became [[Cloak]] through treachery.  He cancelled all contracts of the previous [[Cloak]], including the work of Abram and his father.  Outraged at not being able to be paid for his services, Abram's father confronted [[Darius Kabald]] and left with two broken hands.  Thus began Abram's hatred and mistrust for [[Darklings|Darkling]], and entry into the city guard of [[Brand]] to protect people like his father.

Abram is proud of his upbringing, his service as a city guard, and his new role as watchman for [[The Grey Companions]].  He enjoys the service he provides, and goes out of his way to ensure that he does an excellent job.  He is loyal and trustworthy, and takes pride in his honesty and integrity.  He is fiercely independent, and enjoys the long periods of solitude that guarding and protecting offer to him.

He has a family heirloom that is incredibly rare and valuable.  Three pictures from [[The First Age]] that were passed down from generation to generation.  The family story says that the image of the young man in the picture is Abram's ancestor.  Unknown to Abram, he owns photographs of an ancestor that was in the United States Air Force.  They depict Captain Jonathan &quot;Warhog&quot; Underberg in front of a fighter jet, in the cockpit with full helmet with his co-pilot behind him, and a third with a group of men in flight suits and dark sunglasses holding helmets.  On the back of the photos is a cursive handwritten note saying &quot;My dearest Madison, I miss you and Charlie so much.  Soon this will all be over an I'll be home soon!&quot;.

!Description
The city of Acharutha is built upon a [[large lake|Lake Acharutha]].  The city’s name is actually the [[ancient Elven name|The Sylvan Empire]] of the nearby lake (which translates to ‘Tranquility’).  The lake is the cities primary source of revenue.  The city originally began as a tight-knit fishing community.  Many centuries ago, [[barbarians of the western highlands|Kell]] constantly threatened Acharutha.  To protect themselves, the townsfolk erected [[The Westron Wall]].

!Social Customs
*Every year the citizens of Acharutha hold a festival dedicated to their lake’s inhabitant: [[Ruthie]].  Large floats are constructed depicting her in various forms, which are then paraded through the streets and then placed within [[Lake Acharutha]].
*It is customary for burials to be performed on the lake.  Cremation followed by sprinkling the ashes on the lakes surface is the cheapest form, placing the body on a raft and setting fire to it is more elaborate and expensive.

<pre>On a very rare occasion, a [[Forana'loloKashira]]  is born without the innate talent of [[Sorcery]].  They are called achasiono, roughly translated from [[Elvish]] this means unnatural.  Often they are feared for their unusual traits, as they also lack some of the basic racial traits that are integral to the wood elf (i.e. lack of the Beast Kin ability, lack of Perfect Balance or the desire to pursue romance).

Achasiono tend to be more serious than the traditional [[Forana'loloKashira]] and lack the same sense of humor.  These children often leave and rarely do they return to the [[Havens]].
  
Finally, mothers of achasiono never produce any offspring again.  Whether this is by choice and custom or biological is a mystery.

{{quote{
//&quot;It is not fair! It is not right! But I will make it right... no matter the cost.&quot;//
''-Aereon speaking of the death of [[Staz Amrius Kafanz]]''
}}}
[[Aereon Zara Al-Wali]] (1003 [[AAP]] to Current) was a player character run by [[Erin Disbrow]].  She is an [[Apotheon]], ruling over the domains of ILLUSION/SHADOW, DESTRUCTION, and BIRTH/DEATH.  She was born a [[Human]] woman and raised on the continent of [[Uskard]], niece of one of the most prominent [[Souks|Souk]] of the city of [[Jakah]], [[Slobodon Al-Wali]].  She is versed in the knowledge of [[Occultism]], and attuned to a powerful [[Patron]] that she doesn't fully understand, that she named [[Noerea]].

!Her Parents
Aeron's parents were [[Muztavi Al-Wali]] (younger brother of [[Slobodon|Slobodon Al-Wali]]) and [[Zara Mohan]].  Her mother was an ardent worshiper of [[The Way]], and was considered peculiar even to others who worshiped [[The Obsidian Path]].  She was plagued by visions, and would use divination such as tarot card readings to make even the simplest decisions.  It became clear that she was relying on an [[otherworldly entity|Noerea]] for aid, and her relationship with this entity grew to unhealthy proportions.  [[Zara|Zara Mohan]] claimed it was her [[Patron|Noerea]] which led her to wed [[Muztavi|Muztavi Al-Wali]] and gave her visions of her daughter Aereon.  [[Muztavi|Muztavi Al-Wali]] begged her to stop meddling with powers she didn't fully understand.  But she did not listen; and she became more vocal and less discrete - claiming [[her Patron|Noerea]] had the power to predict the future.  [[The Nissido Dynasty]] became alerted and was quick to act by taking her away.  The government is not kind to dissidents, who are imprisoned and never seen or heard from again.  Her husband [[Muztavi|Muztavi Al-Wali]] was killed in a failed attempt to prevent her capture. In the wake of both of her parents deaths at the age 15, Aereon was taken in and raised by her [[Uncle Slobodon|Slobodon Al-Wali]].

!The Rebellious Youth
Aereon struggled to accept her parent's deaths, and was rebellious.  She was known for being headstrong, rude and overbearing to any suitor who dared court her.  [[Her Uncle|Slobodon Al-Wali]] was saddened by [[his brothers|Muztavi Al-Wali]] death and became highly protective over the rash young girl in his care.  He taught her how to hone and harness her rage, like a cobra stalking its prey.  He was fond of reminding her that [[The Nissido Dynasty]] must be beaten with wit and cunning rather than strength.  She must bide her time for the right moment, then strike.
The only items to remind Aereon of her parents were fragments of notes and scrawling by her mother in a disorganized journal.  She harbored an innate curiosity of these notes and drawings, and began exploring the ruins of [[Jakah]]; delighted when she could match her mother's drawings with anything she could find. 

!Impulsive and Rash
[[Slobodon Al-Wali]] sees the impulsiveness of her mother within Aereon.  She was nearly impossible to predict, and therefore difficult to protect; even for someone as cunning and crafty as him.  Most surprising was during the first [[Festival Of Balance|The Festival Of Balance]] after her parent's passing.  While customary to give a little of your life force, Aereon continued to donate over and over again.  She may have killed herself if [[Slobodon|Slobodon Al-Wali]] hadn't found her and carried her home.

!Leaving Uskard
The news of the slaying of the [[Dragon]] [[Aglanore]] on the outskirts of [[Jakah]] was too much for Aereon to resist.  The promise of treasure and secrets gnawed at her, and she set off for the volcano [[Mount Zgura]] within [[The Temno Mountains]].  The mountains were crawling with members of [[The Athenaeum]], a [[Wizarding|Wizardry]] school in [[Kellos]] who laid claim to the lair.  It was at the base of the Volcano that Aereon found a dormant lava tube with an ancient shrine to some deity of creature.  It was here that she found an egg that later hatched to become an [[Invisible Stalker]]; a being of pure hatred and malice that obediently carries out the desires of its master.  Within the same shrine, atop an obsidian pedestal was one of the fabled five [[Journals|The Journals Of Princess Vesna Zeuxis]] Of Princess [[Vesna Zeuxis]].  It contained an account leading up to [[The Destruction Of Uskard]] in 29 [[IO]], written in ancient precursor language known as [[Uskmali]].  She was only able to parse bits and pieces; but it clearly held many secrets and first hand accounts of [[The Destruction Of Uskard]].  Inside was an account that conflicted with the traditional understanding of events.  [[The Nissido Dynasty]] quickly became aware of her possession of the tome, and saw this as an infringement of property that was the rightful ownership of [[The Dynasty|The Nissido Dynasty]]; punishable by death.  Her [[Uncle Slobodon|Slobodon Al-Wali]] used his power and influence to smuggle her out of [[Uskard]] with only a few of her many items.  She was meant to start again and to never return back.

!Aereon's Patron
[[Aereon's Patron|Noerea]] originally came to her as a large eye in fragments of dreams and visions.  It's ability to speak was limited, but its goals seemed apparent: grow, feed, ascend.  It used a shard of mirror (once owned by her mother) to reflect Aereon's form using a mask of her face.  It was quick to give gifts to appease her, but it was evasive on any questions or queries of its goals.  Simply replying that &quot;this is how it must be, as this is how it was&quot;.  In the beginning, she kept [[her Patron|Noerea]] hidden from everyone; using it for cheap tricks and quick luck.  It eventually grew to become a part of herself, a trusted companion that she named [[Noerea]].  Later Aereon discovered that [[Noerea]] was actually herself from the future - aiding her and [[The Travelers]] to ascend into [[Apotheons|Apotheon]].

!The Travelers
Following [[Noerea's|Noerea]] vague commands. She ended up working for two [[Half-Dwarves|Half-Dwarf]] who were eager about a secret, profitable job. On her path she met up with [[ElethaNori]], an [[Elf]] [[Druid]], a [[Human]] [[Bard]] named [[Wyanne Loom]], and a former [[Orc]] [[Slave]] named [[Staz Amrius Kafanz]].  They name their adventuring party [[The Travelers]].

!The Apotheon
As an [[Apotheon]], Aereon seeks to convert those who have fallen from the path of purity and seek to allow them entry into [[Elysium]].  She has been known to imbue [[Warlocks|Warlock]] with power that has not been tainted by [[Corruption]].  This act causes her to be misunderstood by mortals, many (Even some of the other [[Apotheons|Apotheon]]) see her methods as potentially subversive and dangerous.</pre>

Some mortal bloodlines are susceptible to the influences of [[The Planes Of Existence]], and exposure to another [[Plane|The Planes Of Existence]] can cause both temporary and permanent changes to their spiritual and physical selves.  These individuals are considered [[Planetouched]].

Aglanore (195 [[IO]] - 1025 [[AAP]]), The Unchained, The Eater Of All, The Devouring Flame is a female Red [[Dragon]] who lived within the volcano [[Mount Zgura]] (&quot;Mount Slag&quot; in [[Common]]) within [[The Temno Mountains]] (&quot;Darkspine&quot; in [[Common]]) in the far northern reaches of [[Uskard]] more than a hundred leagues from the last bastion of civilization.

She was captured and chained as a wyrmling by the [[Sorcerer|Sorcery]] [[Shribhanu]] prior to [[The Destruction Of Uskard]], kept as a pet and guardian.  She grew at an alarming rate, breaking her chains, consuming her captor [[Shribhanu]], and razing the city of [[Jakah]] in 29 [[IO]] to fire and ash.  She fled to the [[The Temno Mountains]] where she hatched, and killed the [[Dragons|Dragon]] nesting in [[Mount Zgura]], claiming it as her lair.

Aglanore had a burning hatred for [[Humans|Human]], however has been careful over the centuries not to trifle in their territory.  Gladly feasting on would-be adventurers who stumble into her lair is one thing, knocking over a hornets nest that is a city is another affair entirely.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/items/airship/airship.jpg]]
Airships were invented in 1021 [[AAP]], the first of it's kind being [[The Airship Triumph]].  Airships fly using enchanted crystals known as [[Arkstones]].

Like any ships that sail on the water, airships have masts and sails - however they also possess steering wings that swing out on either side for guidance and stabilization.  Control of the ship was with a traditional wheel to control the rudder and steering panels, and a control rod made of silver and gold that allowed manipulation of the ship's vertical movement.

Airships can land in water and function as a typical sailing vessel - but are versatile in that they can also dock in the air when cities have built docking towers to accommodate the airship.  The invention of the airship revolutionized trade and travel, as they have the ability to move faster than a sailing ship when aloft in the air, can take direct routes to their destination, and do not require the expense of [[Wizards|Magic]] to use [[Teleportation Circles|Teleportation Circle]].

!Notable Airships
[[The Airship Triumph]] was the first prototype airship.  [[The Grey Companions]] were on board for the cross continental maiden flight from [[Zylok]] in [[Kellos]] to [[Vedinium]] in [[Amon]].  It was sabotaged by [[The Emerald Order]] and they ended up finding the lost continent of [[Caldoria]].</pre>

<pre>|Governor:|[[Mazrum Tuul]] head of [[House Tuul]], [[Shield]] of [[Akabele-ethu]], and [[Marshall]] of [[The Waste]]|
|Population:|Estimated average of 16,800.  There are 12,900 registered for taxes ([[Sashes]] are not taxed)|
|Fortifications:|City Walls made of brown sandstone, 1000 [[Sashes]], in which [[Mazrum Tuull]] is in complete control over|
|Law:|The [[Sashes]] and [[White Robes]] keep the city under strict martial law, justice dispensed swiftly by [[The Akabele-ethu Lord's Court]]|
|Resources:|The town has skilled blacksmiths and glassblowers (who make expensive glassware)|

!Description
The walls of the city are breathtaking, as well as the masterful stonework contained within.  The lord's keep is all that remain of the original [[Elvish city|The Sylvan Empire]] that once stood here.  The buildings themselves are made from a brownish sandstone but the many roofs are topped with colored clay tiles that give the city a cheerful appearance.

!Social Customs
*The strictness of the law makes the city very safe - citizens rarely carry a weapon.
*Those who have lived in [[The Waste]] have little shame in showing their bodies.  Due to the oppressive heat, one frequently bathes naked within the [[public bath|The Akabele-ethu Public Baths]].  The heat also has one quickly shedding any heavy clothing during normal day to day activities.
*It is customary for those travelling the city streets to wear veils, or cloth covering their nose and mouth.  This keeps the dust away, and sun off of their skin.

!Notable Characters and Groups
| [img[images/characters/mazrum-tuul/mazrum-tuul-portrait.jpg][Mazrum Tuul]] &lt;br&gt;[[Mazrum Tuul]] |__[[Mazrum Tuul]]__ is the head of [[House Tuul]], [[Shield]] of Akabele-ethu, and [[Marshall]] of [[The Waste]]. He is gruff yet kind.  He cares very much for his citizens and city. |
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-waste/akabele-ethu/vespian-godrund-portrait.jpg][Vespian Godrund]] &lt;br&gt;[[Vespian Godrund]] |__[[Vespian Godrund]]__ is both beautiful and deadly.  She is [[Mazrum’s|Mazrum Tuul]] most trusted adviser and the mouthpiece of the [[Sashes]].  She believes strongly in the preservation of [[Uskardeen]] heritage, and will fight to the death in order to protect her people and ideals.|
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-waste/akabele-ethu/forn-bedjag-portrait.jpg][Forn Bedjag]] &lt;br&gt;[[Forn Bedjag]] |__[[Forn Bedjag]]__ is a previous member of the [[vicious raiders|Raiders Of The Waste]] that often attempt to raid caravans en route to the city.  This dark skinned ruffian is a master of fighting with hands and feet.  He is currently training the [[Sashes]] some unarmed fighting techniques.  He sits well in [[Mazrum’s|Mazrum Tuul]] eyes, due to his newfound loyalty to the city.|

!Places Of Interest
*[[The Nightgate Inn]] is the only inn available outside the city walls when the gates shut for the night.  The Inn is not cheap, seeing as how they have a monopoly on those unlucky enough to arrive at the city before sunrise
*[[The Bloody Dagger]] is a tavern frequented by the town’s less savory folk.  There are always 5 to 10 [[Sashes]] within earshot, ready to break up trouble brewing within.  [[Mazrum Tuul]] is in the process of running the proprietor out of town.
*[[Mother Talbert’s Bathhouse and Spa]] is nearly always filled with patrons.  [[Mother Talbert]] is an overly charismatic woman in her late forties.  The young, subtle water girls (and boys) are only available to the more credible and upper class patrons.  Others have to settle for a simple bath.
*[[The Akabele-ethu Public Baths]] is a public open-air bathing pool.  One may rest and remove the aches and pains from ones joints by wading in the cool waters.
*[[The Man On The Mount]] is a large mountain visible from the city proper.  For countless generations, wise men and hermits have lived here for spiritual renewal, or just good old fashioned solitude.  Often a pilgrim will make the arduous climb up the mountain to ask questions of the oracle at the top.

!Adventuring Hooks
''Evil, Arise'' - A powerful artifact of the long-deceased mage [[Oleyahs]] has been recovered from the ruins of [[Uskard]] and is secretly in transit to [[Kellos]].  Researchers hope that this object holds a key to understanding the destruction of their ancestral home, but when the object arrives, it is revealed to instead be a deceptive casing for the mage's [[Demi-Lich|Lich]] form.  A plague of arcane terror rains on the city, and the characters are tasked to destroy or banish the [[Lich]] from the burning city.</pre>

Akhogga is the [[Human]] variant of the [[Variona'Sha]] ritual of [[Melaniacha'hogga]].  The [[Human]] form is drastically different, in that armor is allowed and the two teams are each allowed to substitute fallen players.  Only chains and blunt weapons are allowed, and all players are allowed shields.  Winning the game is done by removing a necklace from the opposing team’s leader.

The [[Variona'Sha]] frown upon the [[Human]] version of their ritual, finding it bizarre one would play for sport.  They are somewhat flattered that the [[Humans|Human]] would mimic them, and they take the [[Human’s|Human]] blatant display of barbarism in stride.</pre>

Akrofa acts as a harbor for the plentiful fishing found around [[The Wild Reef]], as well as a destination for travelers looking to escape the chaos of city life.  Wealthy [[Amoni]] [[Patriars|Patriar]] either live or visit here, and despite being a quaint locale there are multiple lucrative businesses catering to self-pampering and indulgences.

!Tree And Vine
The fertile land of Akrofa is populated with vineyards that produce one of the sweetest wines in [[Asha]].  Known as [[Akrofa Nectar]], the local [[Patriar]] owned vineyards are extremely competitive and cutthroat - each vying for the commerce and renown.

!Adventure Hooks

!His Bond With The Exalted Black Frost
Akut shares a kinship with [[Lord Filvenedore]], a mutual respect and adoration of equals; and a bond of trust and friendship that is everlasting.  Akut acts as a general to [[The Winter Court]] in its endeavor to rid [[The Feywild]] of the [[Formorian]] threat.

!The Wild Hunt
When the veil between [[The Echo Planes]] is thinnest, Akut bears [[Lord Filvenedore]] on a barbaric display where they collect the blood of mortals in a vain attempt to cure [[Queen]] [[Naurase]] who slumbers gracefully in a bed of ice.</pre>

//A toast to knowledge, a toast to loyalty, and a toast to the greater good ''- Alana Underwood''//
}}}
Alana Underwood (c. 1003 [[AAP]] to Current) was a player character run by [[Elizabeth Disbrow]]

Alana Underwood was born on the 20th of [[Nightal]] (the [[Winter Solstice]]) 1007 [[AAP]] in the fishing village of [[Willowbrook]] in [[The Summerset Isles]] near [[Zylok]].  Her parents are [[Caleb Underwood]] and [[Nia Henrick]], local fishmongers who work hard to provide for their family.  [[Caleb|Caleb Underwood]] has a small fishing vessel, and [[Nia|Nia Henrick]] and the children sell the fish in the village marketplace from a small stall.  Alana is the oldest of five children, her twin brothers [[Cody|Cody Underwood]] and [[Finn|Finn Underwood]], and her younger sisters [[Macey|Macey Underwood]] and [[Luna|Luna Underwood]].

Alana grew up resenting her ordinary life, fantasizing about life as a famous hero.  She read stories of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]], and dreamed of being a powerful [[Wizard|Wizardry]] such as them, and helping save [[Asha]] from the brink of destruction; and that dream was realized.  Tired of reeking of fish, she wanted more from her life than what her parents could provide.  She saw how worn out and common they all were, and wished instead she was born to a noble life.

Every year, [[The Athenaeum]] sends an envoy to the surrounding cities to seek new students.  When she was of age (in the year 1020 [[AAP]]), Alana was more than eager to take the tests that would provide her entry.  The applicants where lined up and each were handed a scroll of Dancing Lights.  They were asked to cast the spell and hold concentration for the full minute.  Most students can't do this without training; and [[The Athenaeum]] only accepts those who show the most aptitude.  Alana excelled, with a rudimentary understanding that concentration was not a physical act but one of accepting oneness with [[Mana]] - gaining this insight from reading stories of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].

Her parents were unaware that Alana applied, and were first hurt and saddened; knowing she would be forced to leave the family for more than 10 years of study.  But they saw how excited she was and they were proud and supportive parents.  As she boarded the vessel to [[The Athenaeum]], she made a quick decision to reinvent herself.  Alana no longer wanted to associate herself with the common fishmongers of [[Willowbrook]] and realizing her appearance matched the local nobles known as [[House Kensington]], created a new identity for herself posing as a distant relative.  She was mortified to learn that one of the Professors of the school was in fact a [[Kensington|House Kensington]].  Alana dropped her ruse as a [[Kensington|House Kensington]] but continued to hold herself with poise and confidence that comes with nobility.  She enjoys dressing in regal clothing, and prefers activities associated with nobility; despite her common upbringing.

She was put into an advisory group with a [[Half-Elf]] named [[Ulan Nailo]] and a [[Tiefling]] known simply as [[Tsoofe Vedelem]].  They became unlikely friends, and found themselves in the midst of much mischief.  Alana is considered lucky for having a [[Familiar]] whose origin is rare and unique.  [[Alana's Familiar|Alana Underwood's Familiar]] is named [[Nyx|Alana Underwood's Familiar]], a [[Sprite]], born from an egg.  It was this group, along with a [[Tabaxi]] known as [[Juro Allast]], that defeated [[The Whispered One]] in 1025 [[AAP]] on her birthday ([[The Winter Solstice|Winter Solstice]]).  During the quest to assemble [[The Spire Of Planes]] and put an end to [[The Whispered One's|The Whispered One]] reign, she was slain by [[Dragon]] fire from the [[Dragon]] [[Aglanore]] the Unchained.  Resurrected by her good friend [[Tsoofe|Tsoofe Vedelem]], she proudly bears the faint burn scars as a reminder of the sacrifice required to accomplish great deeds.

In 1026 [[AAP]] she was recruited by [[Artimas Meliger]] to [[The Athenaeum]] as a [[Professor]] of Evocation, Runes, and Languages.  She is an esteemed member of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].</pre>

When [[Alana|Alana Underwood]] first tried to summon a [[Familiar]], she was surprised to only summon a mysterious egg, while her friends received lively and cuddly animals.  For weeks she cared for this egg, unaware that [[Nyx]] was healing inside; waiting for the time to emerge and serve. </pre>

[&gt;img[images/characters/kellos/the-isles/zylok/the-athenaeum/alastair-neron/alastair-neron.jpg]]
Alastair Neron (990 [[AAP]] - Current) is a Captain in the [[Zylokian Magus]] and Professor of [[Martial Magic]] &amp; [[Abjuration]] in [[The Athenaeum]].

Alastair had an idyllic childhood, brought up in the town of [[Waymeet]] on the outskirts of [[Zylok]] within [[The Viridian Empire]].  He was the treasured son of [[Ser]] [[Arthyan Neron]], a notable [[Knight]] who saw to the protection of the town as it's appointed [[Reeve]].  Alastair learned the skills of a warrior from his father at a very young age.  During his youth, he fostered a strong desire to be knighted like his father; and to this day values strength, courage, and loyalty above all else.

At the age of 18, Alastair joined the [[Zylokian Magus]]; the group responsible for protecting the region using both might and magic.  Here, he developed a unique knack for both [[Wizardry]] and Swordplay.

Here, he distinguished himself as a [[Witchhunter]] for [[The Magian Imperium]]; one who would track down criminal users of [[Magic]] and bring them to justice.  He commissioned a pike, a long bladed spear made from the dark black [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] metal known as [[Kulgrum]] that he named &quot;The Arbiter&quot;.  He traveled to [[Uskard]] to train in [[борбата]] (pronounced &quot;Borbata&quot;) a fighting style unique to the region.  At first, he had multiple situations in which he was taken advantage of; not knowing the language or culture.  He didn't pay his first guide enough, who left Alastair stranded in a dangerous part of the city.  Eventually, he picked up simple words and phrases and an appreciation of [[Uskardeen]] culture and cuisine; but a distaste for their flagrant use of [[Blood Magic]].  He lived within the city of [[Jakah]] for a short time, and became friends with his most trusted guide [[Slobodon Al-Wali]], a young man of similar age.

Following his father's death, Alastair Neron was the absent Lord of the Neron family estate in [[Waymeet]], including the family home.  Instead he settled in the city of [[Zylok]] where he found his calling as a Professor of magical studies in [[The Athenaeum]] under [[Headmaster]] [[Nester Arkwood]].

Alastair considered the students and faculty of [[The Athenaeum]] his family.  He enjoyed being able to impart his martial prowess into the budding [[Wizards|Wizardry]].  Alastair is unlike the other faculty members; 6'1&quot; tall and lean, but with the muscular build of a warrior.  He is a handsome man, whom younger female students from [[The Athenaeum]] have a crush on, and male students aspire to become. He is dashing, daring, and confident; and either ignorant of the adoration of the students or gentlemanly enough to disregard the attention with a kindly smile.

Following the attack on [[The Athenaeum]], Alastair found himself riddled with guilt and fury in the knowledge that he had failed to see the treachery of [[Penelope Kensington]] under his own nose; and allowed his guard to be down within the tranquil walls of the school.  He sees [[Blood Magic]] as a stain on [[Asha]] and harbors a hatred for it that borders on blind and unreasoning.

<pre>The science of distilling the magical essence found within living things is called Alchemy.  One of the oldest and lesser forms of [[Blood Magic]], Alchemy can create concoctions to heal, harm or hinder.  Alchemy is a mechanical process, and can be studied and used by those without magical aptitude.  In fact, knowledge of [[Magic]] confers no bonus to the skill of Alchemy; it is like any science - it just happens that the subject is magical in nature.

!Essence
Alchemy is fueled by the magical essence found within all living things.  Individual recipies for alechmical formulae require specific essence to e successful.  There are currently 9 categories of essence identified: death, life, earth, air, fire, water, light, darkness, and blood.

He became a scientist eagerly searching for ways to repair the damage, being the first to discover [[Leylines]].  It was Alyxian who, with guidance from [[Valouria]] herself, caused [[The First Desecration]] by prying open the [[Leylines]] which were causing [[Valouria]] pain and suffering.

By easing her burden, he destroyed the world; an act for which he has never forgiven himself causing him to go mad with despair.  While still a broken man, he is a brilliant Mathematician and Scientist.  While his mind holds many secrets lost to [[The First Age]], he has no desire in recalling or teaching them - as they dredge up too many memories which make it difficult for him to cope.

As a young boy, Ammenon grew up as a slave in the city of [[Nahajan]] in modern day [[Amon]] in what were called [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]].  He was the oldest of six children, where they and their mother lived in servitude to their master.  Their master was cruel and brutal, having worked Ammenon's father to death in the mines and beat Ammenon and his siblings relentlessly.  Ammenon's mother meant the world to him, and they shared a special bond.  Her death sparked an unending hatred inside of him, which he fed with the practice of [[Blood Magic]], which his mother dabbled in.

He used [[Blood Magic]] to summon a [[Dathairä]] named [[Vaecna]] to aid in the murder of his former master and free his siblings from slavery.  With his new found power and alliance, his desire was to right the injustices of [[Asha]] ending slavery and brutality forever.  However, bargaining with a [[Dathairä]] is tricky, and Ammenon became more corrupt through it's influence in becoming the first mortal to master [[Blood Magic]].  Ammenon was strong of mind and will, and soon saw [[Vaecna]] was just another master controlling him.

Using his newfound power, Ammenon raised an army and swept across [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]], showing no mercy to the former warlords as he subdued the land under his rule.  The final warlord to oppose him, [[Harmost Xawn]] was bested in combat by Ammenon himself; and for his punishment Ammenon broke his will and corrupted his mind; turning him into a faithful bodyguard, servant and slave.  A sign to all those who sought to exert their will over others.

Ammenon chafed at the influence of his new master, and hatched a plan to subdue the [[Dathairä]].  Ammenon invented a ritual to trap [[Vaecna]], and began a tedious process of corrupting and stripping the [[Dathairä]] of it's own sanity.  The process was completed through butchering [[Vaecna]] into parts.  Ammenon finished by replacing his own eye, hand, tongue, heart and blood with that of [[Vaecna]] - giving him the power of [[Truesight]], enhanced strength, the ability to charm, and premonitions of the future that prevented him from being surprised.  It failed to give him what he desired most: immortality.  He knew that his body would die, and the parts of [[Vaecna]] would live on.

From this point forward, Ammenon named himself Ammenon Vaecna - even though the consciousness of the [[Dathairä]] was no more.

He took a fancy to [[Galvandra]], a powerful [[Druid]] who also was infringed by [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]].  [[Galvandra]] studied the mechanics of the [[Human]] body and [[Soul]], using questionable practices.  It was [[Galvandra]] that devised the method by which Ammenon could extend his life indefinitely and transform into the [[Lich]] known as [[The Whispered One]].</pre>

Amon is a [[continent|Geography]] in [[Asha]] landlocked to [[Ruje]].  It is home to [[The Amoni Concord]], one of the largest and most powerful civilizations of [[Humans|Human]] of [[The Fourth Age]].  People that hail from this place are called [[Amonites|Amonite]], and their language is known as [[Amoni]].

Though not proven, it is believed by the people of Amon that they are descended from the first [[Human]] civilization on [[Asha]].  Amon is considered to be the cradle of civilization, the cultures herebeing spread across the continent to [[Kellos]], [[Ruje]] and [[Uskard]].  It is the birthplace of the modern views of democracy, philosophy, and magical study.

The continent of Amon includes terrain as varied as any other; a large expanse of coastline and mountainous regions that give way to fertile grassland and meadows.  The the west is [[The Cauldron Sea]], where major trade routes serve cities across [[Kellos]], [[Ruje]] and [[Uskard]].

[&gt;img[images/races/variant-human/amonite.jpg]]
The Amonite are a [[Race]] of [[Human]] found primarily on the continent of [[Amon]].  They are renowned for possessing great skill, intelligence, and sophistication.  They are the creators of one of the greatest empires [[Asha]] has ever known - [[The Amoni Empire]].  Many modern nations owe their existence to their conquests.  At it's height, [[The Amoni Empire]] and [[Amonite]] culture spread across the continents of [[Ruje]], [[Amon]] and [[Kellos]] and its influence reached as far as [[Uskard]].  Their language of [[Amoni]] is the root of [[The Common Tongue]].  This period of greatness is now a thing of the past and the [[Amonite]] people are now known more for their decadent indulgences as their power on the world stage continues to wane to what was once an extension of them: [[The Viridian Empire]] of [[Kellos]].

In modern day, [[Amon]] is governed by [[The Amoni Concord]], which separates the continent into regions known as [[Politês]], ruled by a [[Tribune]] elected by the elite class known as [[Patriar]].  The [[Religion]] that is most predominant with the Amonite people is [[The Canticle]], which worships the [[Elysian]] with reverence for their known disciplines.

!Appearance
Amonites often possess dark hair, olive skin and green, gray or amber eyes.  It is customary for them to pay particular attention to their appearance, preferring a well-groomed and clean-shaven look, with short hair being the norm for men. Clothing is simple yet elegant, with the signature piece being the [[Alba]], a length of cloth draped over the shoulders and wrapped around the body, similar to a Toga. Sandals with cloth or leather straps complete the outfit. Amonites take pride in their appearance and always present themselves in a dignified and respectable manner.  The [[Alba]] is favored by both genders.</pre>

!Guiding Those Along Their Path
Amrius has initiated and guided countless [[Paladins|Paladin]] in the service of [[The Elysians|Elysian]].  Some of his most notable pupils have been:

During [[The Third Age]], she was a holy woman in the religious order of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  She was renowned for her charitable giving and helping of those less fortunate. It is said that she was troubled when she began to feel small bouts of pity and contempt for those whose lives she sought to improve.  While she was able to quickly move passed these feelings, she wished to purge them from her mind.

[[Zezebazum]] appeared as an ancient mystic who aided her with an elixir to purge herself of her wicked thoughts.  Upon taking the elixir she found she was purged of all evil evil, incapable of even telling a white lie.  This became a terrible burden as she found herself inadvertently insulting and offending others.  She begged [[Zezebazum]] for her wicked thoughts back, who did so a hundred fold.

<pre>An Apotheon is a mortal champion blessed by [[Valouria]].  The Apotheons are gifted with [[Divine Favor]] and have the potential to unlocked abilities that allow them to achieve a level of godhood themselves.  Through trials and tribulations, these champions become enlightened beings, transcending the limits of their own mortality and achieving a level of power and understanding that is beyond mortal comprehension.  In this enlightened state, Apotheons are able to shape the very fabric of reality, altering the course of history and even bending the laws of physics to their will.

!Guiders Of Heaven
While [[Valouria]] anointed [[The First Apotheon]] in [[The First Age]], the concept of an Apotheon was largely unknown until the year 1026 [[AAP]] in which an event known as [[The Apotheosis]] occurred.  At this point, over a dozen mortals were blessed by [[Valouria]] and raised to the status of an Apotheon.  The Apotheons watch over and guide the complex workings of [[Elysium]].  Together with the [[AstraKashira]] of [[The Seven]], they have ushered in [[The Fifth Age]]; one in which all can be accepted into heaven.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/arborea/arborea.jpg]]

Arborea (&quot;Reborn in Peace&quot; in [[Elvish]]) was once a [[Plane|The Planes Of Existence]] of desolation known as [[Limbo]], with relics and ruins from the endless fighting of [[The Eternal Conflict]]. It sat abandoned and dead as both the [[Elysian]] and [[Dathairä]] once had footholds on this [[Plane|The Planes Of Existence]], until their fighting destroyed the very need to control the [[Plane|The Planes Of Existence]] at all. When the [[Apotheon]] [[ElethaNori]] first lay eyes upon [[Limbo]] her heart was saddened and she gifted a seed of life which caused the [[Plane|The Planes Of Existence]] to grow with verdant beauty. She named the place Arborea.

!The Korok
Native to this place are the [[Korok]], creatures made by [[ElethaNori]] herself.  They are small, shy, wooden creatures made from the seed of an [[Elven|Elf]] [[Hearttree]].  They prepare Arborea for the eventual end of [[The Eternal Cycle]].</pre>

<div title="Arcane Focus" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202106261218" modified="202208130103" tags="D&amp;D" changecount="9">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/magic/arcane-focus.jpg]]
An arcane focus is the object through which a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] channels his or her [[Magic]].  They can be fashioned as either staves, rods, or wands.  Irregardless of shape, they are often made from wood and always contain an essence of a creature at their core.  A focus allows a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] to centralize the effects of their spellcasting to manifest more accurate, potent and complex results.

!A Personal Connection
An arcane focus is a deeply personal and valuable instrument to a [[Wizard|Wizardry]].  A bond forms during the creation and assembly of the focus which can't be severed; with a piece of the creator's personality being placed inside.  While it is possible for an arcane focus to take a new master, most are attached to their masters and will not easily discontinue their allegiance to their original creator; if at all.  It would be better served for a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] to acquire a new focus rather than continue to use one that will not take them as a master, as it would not perform at its peak for them.  This effect is why it is common practice for a [[Wizard's|Wizardry]] arcane focus to be buried or burned when its owner dies.

!Magical Echoes
An arcane focus is a quasi-sentient object, although it cannot think or communicate in any means perceptible to living creatures.  The focus learns from the [[Wizard|Wizardry]] as much as the [[Wizard|Wizardry]] learns from the focus.  A focus retains echoes of spells previously cast, which can be analyzed with castings of the [[Identify Spell]].  A [[Wizard|Wizardry]] may call on these echoes from their own focus once a day to cast a single spell (cast normally, using a spell slot) given it was once cast by the focus in the past, even if the [[Wizard|Wizardry]] did not prepare the spell.

!Focusless Magic
A [[Wizard|Wizardry]] finds it difficult to perform [[Magic]] without a focus, and could experience unexpected or volatile results if not done properly.  This requires great skill to perform anything but the most rudimentary spells.  Casting a spell without a focus requires a Concentration Check with a DC of 20 + the Spell's level.  Failing this check causes one of the following events to occur:

| !Roll |!Result |
| 1 |Roll twice to cause two effects. |
| 2 |The spell fails entirely; caster takes 1d6 points of damage per level of the spell cast and loses the spell slot. |
| 3 |The spell is cast on one of the caster's companions (roll randomly). |
| 4 |The spell is cast on a nearby foe/stranger (roll randomly). |
| 5 |The spell is cast on an unintended target (person or object) within range. |
| 6 |The spell only produces a noise an awful odor of brimstone.  Lose the spell slot. |
| 7 |The spell fails entirely; caster loses the spell slot and is stunned (Intelligence Save against DC 25 to recover). |
| 8 |The spell produces only a weak illusion or shadow of its intended effect. |
| 9 |The spell produces the reverse of the intended effect. |
| 10 |The spell produces the reverse of the intended effect, on the wrong target. |
| 11 |Nothing happens except the caster temporarily forgets the spell.  Make DC 25 Intelligence save in one week, and again each following week, until successfully remembered.  Caster can study this spell during this time, but it is a waste of time. |
| 12 |Spell fails entirely and the spell slot is lost.  Caster's arm is crippled requiring 1 week to recover. |</pre>

<pre>Archfey are powerful [[Fey]] beings who reside in [[The Feywild]] and have attained power there that is [[godlike|The Gods]].  Their numbers are few, and most hold positions of prominence among [[Fey Kind|Fey]].  They are physical manifestations of natural power, and are interconnected to [[The Feywild's|The Feywild]] existence.  It is said that they existed and even recall a time before the creation of [[The Feywild]] itself, and were present for it's shaping.  [[The Feywild]] is as much a part of the Archfey as the Archfey is part of [[The Feywild]]; and now they are entwined. The nine Archfey are tied together into what is known as [[The Court Of Stars]].

!First Among Equals
It is not exactly true that all [[Archfey]] were created equal.  [[VanwaHeru]] awoke first, and was considered to be the patriarch of the [[Archfey]] before he was banished and forgotten.  [[Llvarana]] was last to awake, and failed to partake in the early days of [[The Feywild]]; causing him to be estranged from his brethren.  After [[VanwaHeru's|VanwaHeru]] removal from [[The Court Of Stars]], he found himself inexplicably with the equivalent power of two [[Archfey]].

He holds mortals and non-[[Fey]] in contempt, seeing them as fickle and untrustworthy.  [[Lord Filvenedore]] does not delight in the merrymaking and adornment of flowers and beauty like his allies.

//It is Ariuk who guards [[The Gates Of Elysium]], as [[Abalim]] did before him.  He stands vigil against any who dare to assail [[Elysium]], loyal only to [[The Heavenly Chorus]].//
''-[[Serapheal]], writing on Ariuk''
}}}

Ariuk is an [[Archangel]], one of [[The Seven]] that watch over [[Elysium]]. His domain is Duty and Honor, and it is his role to defend [[Elysium]] from threats and guard [[The Gates Of Elysium]].  He wields [[Virion]], [[The Shield Of Honor|Virion]] that was crafted for him by [[The Heavenly Chorus]].

!Abalim's Cherubim
Ariuk was formed in 7900 [[IO]], in the dawn of [[The Third Age]], making him a [[Cherubim]] who never knew [[Lucian]].  It was [[Abalim]] who was bonded to Ariuk, and together they guarded [[The Gates Of Elysium]].  Like all [[Cherubim]], Ariuk feels a strong connection to [[The Elysians|Elysian]].  His connection is stronger than most, and he can hear their whispers at times.

!The Death Of Abalim
Abalim died at the hands of a [[Dathairä]] named [[Dispater]] in 7891 [[IO]], one of a group of former [[Human Souls|Soul]] tormented and corrupted in [[Baator]] who sought to plead against [[The Trials Of Judgement]] initiated by [[The Seven]].  [[Dispater]] was deceitful, and lied, seeking only revenge and power back in [[Baator]].  He killed [[Abalim]] and stole [[Abalim's|Abalim]] [[Gauntlets Of Truth|Oton]] gifted to him by [[Lucian]] herself.  With this holy relic, [[Dispater]] rose to later become a Duke of [[Baator]].
This conflict was known as [[The Siege Of The Fallen]], the only time [[The Gates Of Elysium]] were breached.  While the mob of hundreds of [[Mortal Souls|Soul]] from [[Baator]] began as peaceful beggars for sanctuary; [[Dispater]] began the violence which erupted into chaos.  In response to [[Abalim's|Abalim]] death, [[The Heavenly Chorus]] surprisingly let out a sharp note that could be heard throughout [[Elysium]] as it manifested into a vaguely humanoid shape of pure white light and sound.  It rapidly darted across the mob, entering each individual in turn; their mouths, eyes, and ears bursting with light as they vaporized.  It was only [[Dispater]] and Ariuk who were left standing as the screams of the [[Tormented Souls|Soul]] faded across the field.  [[Dispater]] quickly retreated back to [[Baator]], noting to himself that [[The Heavenly Chorus]] appeared fatigued with each [[Soul]] it consumed.
Ariuk was in awe at the actions of [[The Heavenly Chorus]], and claims that what he witnessed was a mercy and not malevolence.  He believes what he saw was the [[Souls|Soul]] being proven; those worthy being welcomed into [[the chorus|The Heavenly Chorus]] and those not deserving having their [[Soul]] reset for a new life on [[Asha]].  [[The Chorus|The Heavenly Chorus]] then used [[Abalim's|Abalim]] remains to form [[Virion]], [[The Shield Of Honor|Virion]] to gift to Ariuk.  Ariuk speaks of this day fondly, despite the death of his mentor; for he says he saw a new [[God|Elysian]] which rests inside [[Elysium]] in the form of [[The Heavenly Chorus]].

!Stalwart Protector Of Humanity
{{quote{
//...and I have seen a new god, and it is man.  Forevermore we shall stand together, angels and men, in the light of this glorious new dawn.//

Ariuk feels an affinity to the [[Mortal Souls|Soul]] of [[Elysium]], a connection that even rivals his bond with [[Lucian]] and [[The Seven]].  He sees himself as the protector of these [[Souls|Soul]], what he sees as the most beautiful creation and deed done in [[Elysium]].  Ariuk is rigid in his duty to protect the [[Souls|Soul]] of [[Elysium]], and is the most willing to oppose the words of [[The Elysians|Elysian]] in order to strengthen [[The Heavenly Chorus]].</pre>

Much of Armondax's (47? [[IO]] to 26 [[AAP]]) early life is a mystery, however it is known that Armondax settled in an area now known as [[The Dales]].  There he lived a reclusive life inside of a tower in the wild areas of the realm.  He was fascinated with the ancient mysteries of the world, and his tome [[Treatise On Dragonkin]] (written in 15 [[IO]]) is not only the first, but still considered the most complete document on [[Dragon]] anatomy and behavior.  In his research he uncovered the lair of and ancient [[Dragon]] named [[Culdranth]], and subdued him single handed.  During the arduous battle at least two hamlets were destroyed and a city nearly toppled.  This began the feud between [[Mysara]] and [[Armondax]], as [[Mysara]] found his use of [[Magic]] reckless and dangerous.

He was fascinated by the power of elemental fire, and was known as the Wizard of Brimstone.

When [[The Demon Plague]] began, [[Mysara]] sought out Armondax believing him responsible for the death and destruction occurring to the people under her care.  After a brief but powerful exchange of magical combat, the two realized a darker magic was to blame.  Together they combined their magical talents to battle the cult known as [[The Holy Scourge]].  After a series of conflicts, they sent word to both [[Fazar]] and [[Waywill]], two equally powerful mages - and together the four of them brought an end to [[The Demon Plague]].

While the group managed to avert an impending [[Desecration]] locally, [[The Destruction Of Uskard]] saw to a surge of [[Uskardeen]] refugees come to [[Kellos]].  The near destruction at the hands of [[The Holy Scourge]], and inclusion of the magically gifted [[Uskardeen]] saw [[Cyril Viridian]] take power and overthrow [[The Old Republic]].  [[Cyril Viridian]] began the [[Azutan Nagyos]], a war against [[Magic]].  During this time the four mages founded what is now known as [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].  Banded together they fought against [[Cyril Viridian]], self appointed [[Emperor]] of [[Kellos]].  After a few years of fighting, the [[Azutan Nagyos]] ended - and magic was no longer outlawed.

In the peaceful years that followed, Armondax fell in love and married his once rival [[Mysara]].  Together they had a son who was himself a powerful wizard.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/gods/false-gods/aroden.jpg]]
!The Priest
From a young age, Aroden was a devout worshiper of [[The Church Of The Final Atonement]].  He swore an oath and became a [[Templar]] of [[The Church|The Church Of The Final Atonement]], and was the youngest [[Templar]] to have ever been initiated.  Aroden's dedication to his faith was matched only by his compassion for those in need and his intolerance for injustice. He exemplified the virtues of kindness and selflessness, particularly towards the downtrodden, while displaying a harsh, uncompromising and unforgiving attitude towards those who abused their power and thought themselves above the populace of [[The Hegemony]].  It was his unwavering commitment and belief that led him to challenge the corruption he perceived within [[The Church|The Church Of The Final Atonement]].  He vocally opposed the mandatory tithe that was forced upon anyone attempting to enter [[The Temple Of Final Atonement]], often providing financial assistance to those seeking entrance.  His actions and outspoken criticism caught the attention of the higher echelons of power, and earned him enmity within [[The Church|The Church Of The Final Atonement]] hierarchy.

Concerned that his incorruptible nature could threaten their hold on authority, the [[Warlocks|Warlock]] and [[Templars|Templar]] of [[The Church|The Church Of The Final Atonement]] devised a plan to send him to the holy city of [[Horada]].  [[Horada]], known for its opulence and tempation and the birthplace of [[The Church|The Church Of The Final Atonement]] would expose Aroden to the temptations of power, wealth and indulgence, in the hopes that he would succumb and learn to use his position to his advantage.  However, despite the allure of the city and the machinations of those who sought to corrupt him, Aroden remained steaffast in his principles.

Within [[The Shrine Of The Liminal]], Aroden studied the original texts of [[The Book Of Atl]], reaffirming his resolve in his advocacy for the downtrodden and oppressed.  The original holy texts were twisted by the [[Warlocks|Warlock]] and [[Templars|Templar]], and Aroden emerged from his time in [[Horada]] with strengthened faith.  Upon returning to [[Tszanthus]], he renounced his title as [[Templar]] and began publicly denouncing [[The Church|The Church Of The Final Atonement]] and preaching the true word of [[The Book Of Atl]].

!The Preacher
Aroden preached a message of purity, humility, and genuine piety on the streets, gathering a following of like-minded individuals who shared his vision of a more just and righteous society.  However, his outspoken criticism and refusal to conform to the dictates of [[The Church|The Church Of The Final Atonement]] hierarchy earned him the ire of those in power. Aroden and his followers were branded as heretics and enemies of the faith, leading to their excommunication and expulsion from [[The Church Of The Final Atonement]].

Despite being cast out and subjected to ridicule and persecution, Aroden and his [[devoted followers|The Cult Of Aroden]] continued to practice their form of worship in secret, holding clandestine gatherings and ceremonies in hidden locations throughout [[the city|Tszanthus]]. They remained steadfast in their beliefs, finding solace and strength in their shared commitment to righteousness and justice.  They called themselves [[The Champions Of Atl]].

!The Apotheon
As [[The Veil]] of an approaching [[Highstorm]] blanketed the city, Aroden gathered a small number of his closest followers and friends.  There, he waded out into [[The Veil]] with a sense of purpose and destiny.  With each step [[The Veil]] clung to him, pulling the [[Highstorm]] closer, until the elemental forces of the storm began to be absorbed into his mortal form.  Those who witnessed the awe-inspiring spectacle could scarcely believe their eyes as the [[Highstorm]] vanished and Aroden underwent a profound transformation.

Lifting a foot off of the ground, his body coursed with the primal energy of the storm.  His eyes flashed with lightning, and his clothing whipped with unfelt wind.  And in an instant, Aroden was gone; ascending to the realm of [[Elysium]] as an [[Apotheon]].

!The Miracles Of Aroden
During his momentous ascension to [[Apotheon]], Aroden wrought three miracles that would forever alter the course of history and cement his divine legacy.  First, he beckoned the heavens to open before mortal eyes.  In a breathtaking display of divine power, the heavens opened revealing the vast tapestry of stars and cosmic order that governed the universe.  Mortals gazed in awe and wonder, their understanding of their place in the cosmos forever transformed by Aroden's revelation.

Second, with his newfound divinity, Aroden's senses transcended the bounds of mortal comprehension, allowing him to perceive the true nature of [[The Liminal]].  In a moment of profound insight, Aroden chose to spare [[The Liminal]], recognizing its significance in maintaining the delicate balance of existence.

Lastly, Aroden extended his divine protection to his most devout followers, imbuing them with the strength to withstand any storm.

For the city that bears the same name, see the article [[Arroweed]]

A pesky weed whose original [[Elvish|Elvish]] name is Arrowana, or &quot;music weed&quot;, as the hollow stalks make melodious flutes and pipes.  Locals refer to it simply as Arroweed, since it grows straight as an arrow and is often as tough as one.  The weed has a brownish stem and a bushy conical head.  It often chokes other vegetation away due to its quick maturity and tendency to grow in thick clumps.

Indigenous to wetter, cooler climates of the [[The Green Sea]].  Does not grow natively in the other regions.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/kellos/the-isles/zylok/the-athenaeum/artimas-meliger/artimas-meliger.jpg]]

Artimas Titus Warwick Vermillion Meliger (c. 975 [[AAP]] to Current) was a player character run by [[Brian Disbrow]].

Artimas Titus Warwick Vermillion Meliger of [[House Meliger]], [[Headmaster]] of [[The Athenaeum]], [[Zylokian]] [[Arkanus]] First Class, [[Lord Magister]] of [[The Magian Imperium]], [[Archmage]] of [[Brand]] is often one for the dramatics.  As a young boy it was clear Artimas had a fondness for the study of [[Wizardry]].  He was fascinated how he could bend light to form artistic shapes to please his mother.  A native of [[Zylok]], he studied at [[The Athenaeum]] - a prestigious school for the [[magical arts|Magic]].  There he made a rival named [[Rolo Baptiste]], a young lad of noble birth.  To make matters worse, Artimas was not well off and needed to work in order to put himself through school.  Circumstances found him working for [[Rolo Baptiste]]'s father - and [[Rolo Baptiste]] found every opportunity to make Artimas's life difficult.  When his father was not around, [[Rolo Baptiste]] ordered Artimas around like a servant - cruelly commanding him to perform menial chores.  As a young teenager, Artimas found himself at a breaking point and attacked his long time bully, ending with Artimas falling and hurting his back from a botched casting of one of his [[Movement Spells]].  He was expelled from [[The Athenaeum]] around 993 [[AAP]].

He first traveled to [[Amon]] in the city of [[Candlekeep]] where he had a chance encounter with the [[Sorcerer|Sorcery]] [[Endymion Traxigor]].  It was this encounter that caused Artimas to create an illusionary manservant named Rolo.

He traveled [[Amon]] and [[Kellos]], extremely bitter.  Skilled at [[Illusion &amp; Creation Spells]], he would find solace in creating an illusionary manservant he affectionately named Rolo and would treat like dirt.  Artimas is extravagant, and dresses above his station.  He was present at [[Laranor]] [[First Light's Hope]] when [[Gavar Joro]] was murdered, spawning [[The Followers Of Joro]].  In fact it was [[Thermon Verik]] who sponsored Artimas into [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].  He spent time traveling with a group that included [[Erigol Dommi]] until he was called back to [[Zylok]] due to the death of his mother.

Upon his arrival in [[Zylok]], he was horrified to learn his mother was murdered; and her body was used in a [[Blood Magic]] ritual.  She was one of many in a spree of killings across the city.  Fueled by sorrow and rage, Artimas sought the perpetrator; accompanied by his old friend [[Salix Daelof]] (who was now a [[Professor]] at [[The Athenaeum]]).  It soon became clear that the killer was the current [[Keeper Of The Books]] at [[The Athenaeum]] library; none other than [[Rolo Baptiste]].  It would be incorrect to say that Artimas didn't feel pleasure in taking down his nemesis, and handing him over to [[The Magian Imperium]] where he was sentenced to death.

For this act, Artimas was raised to the status of [[Constable]] for [[The Magian Imperium]], had his expulsion from [[The Athenaeum]] expunged from his record, and offered the position of [[Professor]] of [[Illusion]] by [[Nester Arkwood]].

He was appointed [[Headmaster]] after [[Nester Arkwood's|Nester Arkwood]] death during [[The Black Night]] soon after 1025 [[AAP]].  Artimas's good friend, [[Salix Daelof]] finds it in slightly bad taste that Artimas's illusionary manservant is a caricature of [[Rolo Baptiste]]; however most others see it as a befitting retribution.  Beyond eccentric, Artimas can be transfixed upon himself and can be oblivious to the world around him.

He is the inventor of [[The Loqui]], an enchantment placed upon small flat circular rune stones that allow for communication across vast distances.  An illusory image of the person you are communicating with appears to stand on the small handheld stone.</pre>

Ashliel is an [[Archangel]], one of [[The Seven]] that watch over [[Elysium]].  [[Lucian]] chose her for her Mercy and Compassion.  She is the protector of [[Glanduil]], [[The Chalice Of Mercy|Glanduil]].  Ashliel is a healer of wounds both physical and emotional, and assists [[Auriel]] in healing the divide still felt in [[The Seven]] after the fall of [[Shalekasha]].

!Judge Of The Trials
It is Ashliel who oversees [[The Trials Of Judgement]], evaluating [[Mortal Souls|Soul]] for entry into [[Elysium]].  No mortal can stand before [[Ashliel]] and not feel compelled to confess and repent of their sins.  She will never cease to be amazed by the mortal spirit, considering they have so much to lose and aren't blessed by the [[Elysian]].

!Mercy, Even For The Wicked
Ashliel loves the wicked as much as she loves the just, and encourages all to forgive those who have caused them hurt; for hate weighs heavy on one's [[Soul]].  It is Ashliel who forces [[Souls|Soul]] to peer into [[The Chalice Of Mercy|Glanduil]], reassuring them that all [[Souls|Soul]] can have a place in [[Elysium]] if they can free themselves of hate, and repent their sins.  However, there are some wounds that even Ashliel can not heal.</pre>

The AstraKashira are a form of [[Archon]], or spirits created by [[The Elysians|Elysian]] to help fight in the eternal struggle against [[Azarad-Ji]] and his [[Dathairä]].  The AstraKashira were once numerous, although many have fallen in battle and only a few remain.  They reside in [[Elysium]], the [[Plane Of Existence|The Planes Of Existence]] that was once the home of [[The Gods]].

[[Lucian]] birthed the AstraKashira in response to the [[Dathairä]] of [[Azarad-Ji]] and the [[unending war|The Eternal Conflict]] between [[Azarad-Ji]] and [[The Elysians|Elysian]].  Only a few AstraKashira have questioned their purpose in [[The Eternal Conflict]], fewer still have acted upon it.  Their very fiber of being is dedicated to the ideals of order, in direct opposition to [[Dathairä]].

At the end of [[The Second Age]], [[The Elysians|Elysian]] locked themselves behind [[The Divine Gate]] in an attempt to block [[Azarad-Ji]] from influencing the mortals of [[Asha]].  [[Lucian]] left her force of AstraKashira behind to preserve order and guide mortals in her absence; for [[Lucian]] saw great potential in these children of [[Valouria]].  She appointed [[The Seven]]; seven of her most trusted and beloved [[AstraKashira]] to guide others in her absence.

!Heavenly Hierarchy
Among the AstraKashira, there exists a strict social stratification that guides their occupation, ritual status within the hierarchy, and customary social interactions.  The most prevalent and impactful structure is based upon age an seniority.  AstraKashira formed after the closure of [[The Divine Gate]] are known as [[Cherubim]].  They have not known directly the feeling of [[Lucian's|Lucian]] embrace.  Their creator is [[The Heavenly Chorus]] and not [[Lucian]] directly, therefore they are (at times) seen as separate and unique from the original AstraKashira.  There are customarily seven [[Archangels|Archangel]], known as [[The Seven]] that have the highest authority among the AstraKashira.  Many were appointed by [[Lucian]] herself, and still serve in this position.  The [[Archangels|Archangel]] are revered as the voice of [[Lucian]] in her absence, and their direction is followed without question by their peers.
On rare occasions where an AstraKashira would take a mortal lover, his or her descendants would be [[Aasimar]]; with trace elements of AstraKashira heritage.  These children are very rare.

''-[[Shalekasha]]''
}}}
In 2027 [[IO]], [[Shalekasha]] descended from [[Elysium]] to come to the aid of the [[Draugaira]] [[Elves|Elf]].  While her involvement aided in winning the conflict and defeating [[The Whispered One]], her [[Soul]] was corrupted by the [[Dathairä]] [[Zezebazum]].  He corrupted her spirit with his silver tongue, convincing her that the [[Human]] race was vile and would never relent in their pursuit of [[Blood Magic]].  She took the mantle as the lord of [[Avernus]], the first layer of [[Baator]] - where she actively seeks to destroy [[Blood Magic]] and its practitioners; cleansing [[Asha]] for good.  With her fall from grace, [[The Seven]] are not whole and the harmony of [[Elysium]] is discordant.  She has not been replaced within [[The Seven]], and the council is deadlocked on what to do.

!Characteristics
The AstraKashira are powerful immortal entities, and only the most fearsome of [[Dathairä]] could rival them in power.  AstraKashira have immense fighting prowess, honed from battle in [[The Second Age]].  They are humanoid in shape, paragon's of beauty and grace with large feathered wings.  AstraKashira are devout followers of [[Lucian]], their creator.  They hold vigil over the universe whilst their master holds the darkness at bay beyond [[The Divine Gate]].

!Adventuring Ideas
''Statue Garden'' - Rumors reach the coast that a hidden mountain valley holds a mysterious collection of statues.  The characters are hired to accompany a noble to investigate the nature of this strange observance, only to discover that numerous other parties have been already added to this display.

''Bring 'em Back'' - [[Talamin Raanan]] a [[Half-Elf]] assassin disappeared over five years ago, but spies report that she resides in a backwater town under the name [[Valemis Tirdra]].  One of the local constables wants to see her pay for her crimes, and hires the characters to capture her.  When the characters find Talamin, they learn that all she desires is to leave her violent past behind and live out her days with her new family, including her two young children.

''Chaos Companions'' - While the characters visit the city, they witness a noble drop dead as a creature bursts from her chest.  More nobles die in the same way as the characters investigate.  They eventually discover that the victims all visited the same brothel, an establishment run by a creature in disguise.

''A Friend In Need'' - The characters stumble onto a backwater village preparing to kill a woman half covered in black [[Dragon]] scales.  She is [[Calianna]], a unique [[Human]] [[Sorcerer|Sorcery]] with a [[Draconic Bloodline]].  She breathlessly describes a terrible cabal known as [[The Cult Of The Caustic Heart]] and requires the characters' aid in vanquishing it once and for all.

''A Book By Its Cover'' - A small group of [[Trolls|Troll]] have made a home in some local ruins.  When one of the young daughters in the town goes missing, [[Troll]] attacks increase.  The characters are hired to go deal with the problem.  Turns out the [[Trolls|Troll]] found the lost girl and are protecting her from a small war-band of [[Orcs|Orc]] who are scouting the nearby area; looking for their lost [[Trolls|Troll]].  The &quot;attacks&quot; are just the [[Trolls|Troll]] attempting to return the girl.

''Cave Of Fear'' - The characters are captured by cannibalistic tribals (big bald men with bodies painted black and faces white).  Death seems immanent, until they meet the &quot;queen&quot; who is regal and civilized.  She explains her brother &quot;the king&quot; and her were taken care of by the tribe.  She feeds them a glorious meal and apologizes for their treatment.  She explains they trespassed and violated a sacred burial ground, a taboo punishable by death.  They can earn their freedom if they retrieve the bones of the king; in The Cave Of Fear.  Another taboo place the tribals do not enter as it is covered in psychedelic slime that causes hallucinations (fear).</pre>

{{quote{
//Auriel's voice conducts the melody of [[The Heavenly Chorus]] of [[Elysium]].  It is through her that the power of hope flows into the fabric of creation.  Her eternal light can illuminate the darkest of [[Souls|Soul]].  With [[Shalekasha's|Shalekasha]] absence, it falls to Auriel to hold [[The Seven]] together.  Should her light ever fade, all of [[Elysium]] would fall to despair.//
''-[[Serapheal]], writing on Auriel''
}}}

Auriel is an [[Archangel]], one of [[The Seven]] that watch over [[Elysium]].  [[Lucian]] chose her to provide Hope to all within [[Asha]].  She is the keeper of [[Alavara]], [[The Cord Of Hope|Alavara]], which grants her clarity and wisdom.  It is Auriel who tends to the harmony and rhythm of [[The Heavenly Chorus]], nurturing it with love and hope.  Along with [[Ashliel]], she works to heal the divide still felt within [[The Seven]] due to the fall of [[Shalekasha]].  She often acts as the mediator of [[The Seven]].

!When Hope Was Lost
The fall of [[Shalekasha]] was a devastating blow to [[The Seven]], and it was at this moment that Auriel saw no hope in redeeming their former leader.  To the surprise of those around her, it was the first and only time that Auriel showed rage.  She remains steadfast that [[Shalekasha]] is beyond redemption, and should never be allowed back within [[Elysium]] let alone reclaim her position within [[The Seven]].  When questioned on the matter, Auriel suggest that Hope is not foolishness or pacifism and it does not shy away from strife, recognizing that conflict is necessary in this universe.  While love and compassion are things to be valued in both war and peace, there are those in this world who add discord to the melody and must be removed for the song to have meaning.

!The Heavenly Chorus
[[The Heavenly Chorus]] is tended to by Auriel, who does so with delicate care.  [[The Chorus|The Heavenly Chorus]] was formed with the light and life of the [[Mortal Souls|Soul]] that [[The Seven]] allowed entry into [[Elysium]] and has grown in power beyond any of their expectations.  It was [[Auriel]] who first noticed [[The Chorus|The Heavenly Chorus]] manifesting powers such as singing [[Cherubim]] into existence.  A power seen only when [[Lucian]] was within the realm of [[Elysium]].  Auriel sees the importance and potential of the [[Mortal Souls|Soul]].  

!The Beacon Of Hope
{{quote{
//Hold on to hope; it will not abandon you.  Hope is the spring that fills the wells of courage.  Hope is the light in the darkness.  And in the darkness, I will be that light!//
''-Auriel''
}}}
Auriel is the most lighthearted of [[The Seven]].  Her hope can flow through the fabric of creation, illuminating the darkest of [[Souls|Soul]].  She believes in the potential for good in all things, including [[Dathairä]].  It is Auriel who often can see harmony even in the midst of discord, helping add a counter voice to [[The Seven]].  [[Alavara]], [[The Cord Of Hope|Alavara]] has the ability to bathe those nearby with empathy and calmed emotions, a physical embodiment of her role as a beacon of hope.</pre>

<div title="Avernian Warlord" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202111201534" modified="202212021446" changecount="6">
<pre>The Warlords Of [[Avernus]] gain their title from wealth and power.  Only the strongest survive long, which is typical in the harsh environment of [[Avernus]].  Each warlord controls a region of [[Avernus]], owing their fealty to the [[Duke]] of this layer of [[Baator]].  They control a militia through fear and an iron fist, tasking them to harvest [[Souls|Soul]] and tame the wild lands of [[Avernus]].  Being a warlord of [[The First Layer Of Baator|Avernus]] is a difficult task, as this layer is the entry point for [[Souls|Soul]] and the work is thankless and never ending.

!Known Avernian Warlords

She is a [[Hag]], who presents a grandmotherly facade that hides a monstrous temper if provoked.  She was one a member of [[The Coven Of The Bramble Root]] with [[Red Ruth]], but is now content to consolidate her power as a solitary [[Hag]].  She is feared by the other [[Warlords|Avernian Warlord]] for her ruthlessness, cunning, and unpredictability.|</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/baator/avernus/avernus.jpg]]

Avernus is the first layer of [[The Nine Hells Of Baator|Baator]], known as &quot;The Circle Of Pride&quot;.  It is the most likely visited by those not from [[Baator]]. as it is the most outward facing layer.  It is here that [[Souls|Soul]] from dead [[Humans|Human]] find themselves if they were cruel in their deeds during life.  The overlord and Duke of this layer was slain by the [[Apotheon]] [[Staz Amrius Kafanz]], who wrested it from the clutches of [[Shalekasha]] when she would not accept redemption.  He endures the torment of Avernus and retains his power as an [[Apotheon]] as he seeks to bring light and redemption to the pitiful souls who find themselves here.  It is only a matter of time before the hordes of [[Baator]] overwhelm him and usurp the foothold he has achieved.  He wields [[Ithronel]], [[Shalekasha's Sword Of Justice|Ithronel]] gifted to her by [[Lucian]].

!Avernus Welcomes All
Whether living or dead, Avernus is the entry point to [[Baator]] and the most commonly visited of [[The Nine Hells|Baator]].  Damned [[Human Souls|Soul]] come through Avernus as [[Soul Larvae]] that are birthed from [[The River Lethe]].

!The Lord Of The First
There is no current active Lord Of The First, as the [[Apotheon]] [[Staz Amrius Kafanz]] wages his holy war against [[Baator]] and has succeeded in gaining a foothold in [[Avernus]].  His goal is to find and cleanse as many souls as he can, earning glory for the [[Dathairä]] he defeats along the way.  Under perpetual attack, his position in Avernus is fleeting and he will likely succumb to the horde.  He has commandeered [[The Bronze Citadel]] which is a floating fortress.

!Geography
Avernus served as one of the many battlegrounds during the battles between [[The Gods]] and [[Azarad-Ji]] in [[The Second Age]].  It remains a blasted hellscape of barren hills, low rocky mountains, and red sand as far as the eye can see.  Occasionally it is dotted with small groves of alien flora that cling to life among the harsh climate.  The jagged rocks that protrude from the ground trick the eye to resemble tormented faces.
The clouds are red and the air acrid from the demonic smoke that spews from [[The Central Pit]], ambient light permeating the realm at all hours.  The atmosphere has neither sun nor stars, only a constant blood-red light that suffuses the air.  Giant rolling clouds of blighted flies and insects tear at flesh and bone alike.  Acidic rain of blood falls occasionally from the sky, painting the landscape in red.  Practically all of Avernus is bathed in a coat of blood and covered with bones and gore.
Everything here is dangerous and twisted, including what flora and fauna survives here.  Most all of the living things were once twisted, [[Tormented Souls|Soul]] spewed forth from [[The River Lethe]].
In many areas of Avernus, the very ground is like flesh.  It moves and undulates at the touch, and bleeds if damaged.  Unwary travelers may find themselves in danger when they step into a hole that is covered in teeth and attempts to consume them.

!Places Of Interest
* [[The River Lethe]] courses through the lower planes, starting here in Avernus.  The waters have the power to inflict amnesia and memory loss upon those that touch or drink of it.
* [[The Central Pit]] is a massive crater-like hole that sits in the center area of Avernus and contains all of the lower circles of [[Baator]].  The view from the rim would no doubt be staggering if it weren’t the source of the toxic smoke that covers the sky on the rest of [[Avernus|The Circle Of Pride]].
* [[The Bronze Citadel]] is a central power structure within Avernus.  This massive structure is forged entirely from metal, and gleams like a beacon due to its new owner.  It floats throughout the region, and is home to the occupier of Avernus, [[Staz Amrius Kafanz]]
* [[The Wandering Emporium]] is a traveling bazaar that winds its way across [[Avernus]].  It is under the direction of [[Mahadi]], a [[Rakshasa]] that claims [[Gargauth Souldrinker]] as a patron.
* [[The Mold Thicket]] is a grove of mushroom-like flora known as [[Vile Fungus]] that grow large like trees.
* [[Fort Embermourne]] lies on the outskirts of [[The Mold Thicket]] and is home to [[Mad Maggie]], an [[Avernian Warlord]].  It is a ramshackle fortress that is a gateway to [[The Avernian Wastes]].
* [[The Bone Brambles]] is home to [[Red Ruth]], a [[Hag]] of some renown when it comes to [[Divination]].  [[The Bone Brambles]] are a piece of [[The Feywild]] brought here to Avernus in order to enhance [[Red Ruth's|Red Ruth]] power.
* [[The Tower Of Urm]] is home to the [[Human]] [[Sorcerer|Sorcery]] named [[Vordos]], a brave soul who is selfish and cruel.  He has transported his tower here to Avernus and has performed unspeakable acts to continue to prolong his life.  He can be quite charming, but eccentric and twisted from his time here.
* [[The Mirror Of Zezebar]] is a slab of polished ice that acts as a window to [[Cania]], the 8th layer of [[Baator]].  Here, if one is lucky, one in Avernus can gain an audience with [[Zezebazum]], the [[Dathaira]] who presides over [[Baator]]
* [[The Avernian Wastes]] are an expanse of red sand desert, full of [[Avernian Warlords|Avernian Warlord]] who prey on the lost [[Souls|Soul]] that travel these desolate lands.
* [[The Malmaw Funnel]] is a large pit lined with teeth.  It ripples and flexes and attempts to digest and eat anything that enters.  It is said that [[The Malmaw Funnel]] is a path of [[Malbolge]], although few are bold enough to enter.

!Former Rulers Of Avernus
* [[Shalekasha]] - a fallen [[AstraKashira]] who was converted by [[Zezebazum]] due to her scourge on [[Blood Magic]] brought on by her battle with [[The Whispered One]].
* [[Gargauth Souldrinker]] - still lives and plots to return to his rightful throne.  He still has many allies across Avernus who wish to see him in power once again, removing the outsider from [[Avernus]] once and for all.</pre>

Avix Ivumorn (c 968 [[AAP]] - 1025 [[AAP]]) was a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] that specialized in [[Enchantment]] and magical equipment and was a teacher at [[The Athenaeum]] in the city of [[Zylok]].  He was born in 968 [[AAP]], to wealthy parents in the city of [[Zylok]] - and entered [[The Athenaeum]] as a student.  Throughout the years that he studied, he struggled to find a school of [[Magic]] that suited him.  He specialized in [[Conjuration]], as he had a desire to &quot;make&quot; things with [[Magic]]; yet he never was fully satisfied with the results he achieved.

As [[Headmaster]] [[Nester Arkwood]] rediscovered [[Echantment]], Avix became intrigued with the prospect of imbuing items with [[Magic]] and became [[Nester Arkwood's|Nester Arkwood]] assistant.  Since [[Nester Arkwood]] was far superior in the skill of [[Enchantment]], Avix struggled to contribute to the creation of the [[Arkstones]] which powered [[The Airship Triumph]].  However he did invent a technique named [[The Avix Link]] which allowed multiple [[Wizards|Wizardry]] to contribute their [[Mana]] to the creation of an artifact.  This was instrumental in the invention of the [[Arkstones]]. 

Avix was the professor of [[Enchantment]], and the overseer of [[The Athenaeum's Maker Space]]; a place where materials are provided and available for Upper School students to experiment and invent with.  This space is focused on student centered inquiry, and often the place students use in order to complete their [[Student Independent Project]].

As [[Nester Arkwood]] had continued to rediscovering deeper secrets of [[Enchantment]], Avix had been struggling to keep up with the [[Headmaster]] - he found his knowledge eclipsed and he was often out of his depth.

He was slain in 1025 [[AAP]] during the events of [[The Black Night]].  He died heroically defending his students.</pre>

!Description
The [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] [[Stronghold]] of Avorbarath (translation &quot;grey blood&quot;) is found on the continent of [[Kellos]] in the region known as [[The Isles]].  It is said to be the earliest settlement of [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] on the continent, who settled here after their awakening from [[Kombar]] early in [[The Third Age]].  The [[Stronghold]] is built on a massive scale, with many doorways large enough that even a [[Dragon]] could pass through them with ease.  The entrance to the [[Stronghold]] is found within [[The Valley Of Khedrar]] (&quot;The Valley Of Eternal Heat&quot;) where the outpost of [[Waymeet]] can be found.
The fallen Fire [[Primordial]] [[Aaort]] lies beneath the [[Stronghold]], the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] use the decaying body's heat for their forges and machines.  This magical flame is more powerful than traditional heat, allowing for crafting the likes of which are unparalleled on the face of [[Asha]].
It was [[Baern Ungart III]] who first mastered the power of [[The Burning Heart]].  He created masterworks while harnessing the full potential of primordial fire.
The [[Stronghold]] is separated into districts.  The Starlight District is on the northern side of the city, named for its fungus lighting the ceiling like stars in a night sky.  This district houses crafts and trades.  The Cairnhammer District is in the southeast of the city, and where one can find [[The Iron Tabernacle]] and a waygate/teleportation circle.  The Flowstone District is near the entrance in the northwest, home of [[The Underdome]] and a bazaar where travelers and visitors often stop for shopping.  The West Cleft District exists within another cavern, and where farms and guilds can be found.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/darkones/the-old-ones/azarad-ji.jpg]]

Azarad-Ji is an evil entity which wishes to lead the sentient beings of [[Asha]] astray, and bring about [[Desecration]].  Azarad-Ji is one of [[The Elder Gods]], and possesses great power.  He is the most powerful and active of [[The Elder Gods]].  The [[Larabira]] states that Azarad-Ji infiltrated [[The Void]], attacking [[The Gods]], severing the hand of [[Kombar]], and killing [[Valouria]].  At the end of the battle Azarad-Ji was imprisoned, protecting the world from his direct influences.  However his servants, the [[Dathairä]] are able to perform his bidding when in mortal form upon [[Asha]].

[[The Horn Of Azarad-Ji]] was presented to the most prominent of Azarad-Ji's soldiers.  [[The Heart Of Azarad-Ji]] is a magical artifact created by [[Qualok]] by absorbing Azarad-Ji's power and concentrating it into a crystalline structure.  This was done prior to locking Azarad-Ji away in his prison.

Cultists who worship Azarad-Ji refer to themselves as [[The Risen]] - believing they are special and singled out by their patron and will be granted immense power when their master eventually escapes from his prison.</pre>

After [[The Destruction Of Uskard]] many [[Uskardeen]] took refuge in [[Kellos]].  [[Magic]] was running rampant, many fearing for their lives as those that would twist magic for their own gains were common.  [[Cyril Viridian]], banded an army together under the banner of Azutan Nagyos, to purge magic from the lands.

What is now known as [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]] was formed to combat the outlaw on magic, and [[Armondax]], [[Fazar]], [[Waywill]], and [[Mysara]] (all great wizards) pushed back against [[Cyril Viridian]] and his army.

The war lasted years, and abruptly stopped, and the ban on magic was lifted.  It is not documented as to why the war ended, however [[Cyril Viridian]] saw to the foundation of [[The Magian Imperium]] to govern the use of magic throughout [[The Viridian Empire]]</pre>

<pre>Baator is one of [[The Planes Of Existence]], home to [[Dathairä]].  It is a plane aligned to cruelty, where [[Mortal Souls|Soul]] that have lived a more evil life migrate in their afterlife.  Baator is organized into nine regions, each with their own physical laws and properties that mirror the malevolent characteristics of its ruler.  The original layers of Baator span from [[Stygia]] to [[Nessus]].  The layers above [[Stygia]] are held aloft by a thick chain known as [[The Spine]].  Those layers grow like a tumor from this chain.

<div title="Babaroga" creator="Elizabeth Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202312242008" modified="202401042252" tags="person fey Archfey hag" changecount="20">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/the-feywild/archfey/babaroga.jpg]]
Babaroga (in [[Elvish]] &quot;The Veil Weaver&quot;) is an [[Archfey]] from [[The Feywild]].  She is the progenitor of all [[Hags|Hag]], who she gifted to her [[Fated]] [[VanwaHeru]].  Her children revere her for her power and reign, and she is said to feel the pull of her children and feel their pain.  She is not particularly motherly, but it is said that she can sense a slayer of one of her [[Hags|Hag]] on sight and shows no mercy.  While she is not kind, she is gentle towards children and those who show her the respect and reverence she has earned over her extensive existence.

!The Court Of Stars
She is [[Fated]] to [[VanwaHeru]] and was there for the rise of his tyrannical reign and admired his drive for power.  He adored her, and she offered him her [[Legion Of Hags|Hag]] in exchange for [[his heart|The Heart Of VanwaHeru]].  Her destiny was intertwined with his, and she was expected to rule alongside of him as his equal.  Babaroga ignored this compulsion, preferring instead to rule from the shadows.  While she denied her rightful title of power, she found [[VanwaHeru's|VanwaHeru]] presence comforting.  She whispered thoughts of power and coercion to influence his plans.

Babaroga warned [[VanwaHeru]] of her vision of a dangerous that a more powerful [[Archfey]] not of [[The Feywild]] would one day usurp him.  She was not surprised or impressed by his rage, but offered him a solution.  It was Babaroga who taught [[VanwaHeru]]  the powerful technique of grafting traits and lineages.  Enraptured by this and inspired by her teachings, he developed [[The Quicksilver Program]].  He entrusted her and her daughters to raise his [[Feytouched]] child [[Naurase]], the result of this program.

During the fall of [[The Court Of Stars]], Babaroga was conveniently missing, leaving [[VanwaHeru]] to his punishment alone.  With [[The Crystal Of Zenriah]], no [[Curse||Afflictions]] can befall her, and the deeds and memories of [[VanwaHeru]] haven't been removed from her.  Despite this, she doesn't attempt to free him or [[Naurase]] from the prisons that entomb them.

!The Subjugation Of Zenriah
In her experimentation with [[The Quicksilver Program]], she became infatuated with understanding the origin of [[Humanity|Human]] and their source of life.  While other [[Races]] were created and designed as agents of an [[Elysian]], [[Humans|Human]] appeared to have a unique source that was overlooked as inconsequential by all others.  Intrigued by the [[Humans|Human]], once [[The Quicksilver Program]] was complete, she soon discovered what she named as [[The Valourian Veil]].  She was particularly surprised to find the crystal golem [[Zenriah]] guarding [[The Veil|The Valourian Veil]].  Their crystal skin was forged with the raw power of [[Kombar]] himself.  She subdued the golem in an equally matched and fierce battle that lasted a [[Tenday]].  While gravely wounded, [[The Valourian Veil]] healed her injury, and she forged [[Zenriah's|Zenriah]] body into [[The Crystal Stave Of Zenriah]], which acts as the key to entering [[The Veil|The Valourian Veil]], and she wields it with honor and reverence.  [[The Stave|The Crystal Stave Of Zenriah]] still pulses with the beating energy of [[Zenriah]].

!The Valourian Veil
After her defeat of [[Zenriah]], Babaroga remains the sole guardian of [[The Valourian Veil]], [[The Crystal Stave Of Zenriah]] acting as the single key to the forgotten and magical source of [[Valouria]] that holds the essence of life.  Babaroga guards its whereabouts and is keener to kill its seekers rather than grant entrance.  To this day she has deemed none worthy of its waters.  She imbued a flower to contain her soul and planted it inside [[The Valourian Veil]], protecting her so that she can never truly die unless the flower is destroyed.

!The House Of Black Lanterns
After the fall of [[The Court Of Stars]], Babaroga retreated to [[The Shadowfell]] where she wished to free herself of the burden of [[The Heart Of VanwaHeru]].  She forged [[The House Of Black Lanterns]], and after some time said her farewells to [[The Heart|The Heart Of VanwaHeru]] and promptly traded [[The House Of Black Lanterns]]; which continued to pass from owner to owner until Babaroga's name was no longer associated with [[The House|The House Of Black Lanterns]].

!The Morrigan
In numerous [[Human]] cultures, Babaroga is known as [[Morrigan]]; a spirit entity closely associated with war and destiny, particularly in the ominous aspects of fortelling doom, orchestrating death, or heralding victory in battle.  Manifesting in various forms, she appears as a dark-hued animal, such as a crow or black stag.

Seeing such an animal was a harbinger of imminent death, and a symbol of an influential force that was shaping the outcomes of significant events.  The presence of a crow soaring overhead or the sighting of a distant black stag serves as an ominous portent of the proximity of misfortune, death or doom.  [[Morrigan]] is described as making appearances in visions, especially to those fated to meet their end on the battlefield. These visions serve as an eerie connection between her and those destined for a deadly fate, solidifying her role as a mystical force entwined with the threads of war and destiny.</pre>

It was him who first mastered the power of [[The Burning Heart]], creating masterworks with the harnessed fire of the fallen [[Primordial]] named [[Aaort]], who lay deep under the mountain.  It is said that he spurred a golden age of craftsmanship and forging, the likes of which have not been seen in [[The Fourth Age]].

!The Hammer Of Devotion
It was Baern Ungart III (in 7592 [[IO]]) who devised the techniques to repair the crack within [[The Hammer Of Devotion]], restoring its [[Enchantment]], using the [[Primordial]] fire of [[Aaort]].  The [[hammer|The Hammer Of Devotion]] remains the symbol of [[The Undermountain Papacy]].

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/bairn.jpg]]

The Bairn are a race of short cheerful humanoid creatures that rarely are above 4 feet in height or heavier than 40 pounds found primarily in [[The Northlands]] of [[Kellos]].  They are slender with pointed ears and in many respects resemble small human children, and as such are also referred to as [[Halflings|Halfling]], or Kinder (meaning child in [[The Old Tongue]]).  The males struggle to grow facial hair, clean shaven faces being the norm.  Full beards are rare, with some managing only stubble, goatees or mutton chops.

!Small And Practical
The Bairn survive in the world of larger creatures by avoiding notice.  They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothing; although some do prefer to favor bright colors.  Their practicality extends beyond clothing.  They're concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation.  Even the wealthiest of Bairn keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see.  They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.

Most Bairn live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves.  They rarely build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond what they need to subside.  They don't recognize any formal nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them.  They pride themselves on their traditions.  They are forthright, neighborly, non-threatening race, and most other people are fond of them.  The Bairn are not overly religious.  They are tolerant of the religions of other cultures, and tend believe that as long as things are going well the gods and religion are better left alone.  The Bairn make excellent innkeepers or restauranteurs.

!Unfazed By The Peculiar
The Bairn are curious folk, and love discovering new things.  In the world of the Bairn, everything is strange and as long as they don't bother the Bairn, the Bairn don't bother them.  They treat all strangers with courtesy, no matter how strange they are, as long as they are well-behaved.  The Bairn are unfazed by fear, but don't take kindly to those who are rude or rowdy.  Bairn are known to remain civil even when they are forced to violence.  This deep seeded wonder makes them adaptable to even the strangest cultures.  They are fun loving and can be tricksters, loving puns, games and pranks.  Their natural charisma and fondness of cultures makes them charming and delightful hosts.  They are also remarkably good at sniffing out frauds and humbugs.  Many a con man has gone away congratulating themselves on their success among the Bairn &quot;rubes&quot;, only to find later that they are the ones who came out on the short end of the deal.

!Hide The Valuables
The Bairn have a slight negative reputation with other [[Races]] for &quot;borrowing&quot; items and not returning them.  While this resembles Kleptomania, the Bairn simply are borrowing the item and have all intentions of returning it to it's rightful owner.  It would be in very bad taste to sell or make a profit from any borrowed item.  Any right minded Bairn would be offended if their borrowing was thought of as thievery.  Their curiosity extends into a love of magic, gadgets and strange items.

!The First Men
The Bairn occupied [[Kellos]] alongside of [[The First Men]].  Their original language, villages and culture is lost, as they have fully integrated and adapted to fit into [[Human]] society. 

!Names
All Bairn have both a personal and a family name.  First names are short and meaningless (presumably artifacts of the lost Bairn language) [eg Todo, Fastolph, Berilac, Skanlan].  Family names are usually meaningful in the local tongue, and are nature oriented (Thorntree, Hilltop, Redapple, Loamsdown).  A few very old families have equally meaningless family names (Maggo, Gilli, Kork).

!The Ordning
After the events of [[The Apotheosis]] in 1026 [[AAP]], the Bairn felt a calling inside of [[The Ordning]] that forever changed them.  The Bairn's natural tendency to enjoy life to its fullest, and their ability to consume more food than appears to be physically possible has established [[The Ordning of Leisure]].  While this has created a newfound kinship between the [[Jötnar]] and the Bairn of [[Kellos]], most Bairn simple ignore calling of [[The Ordning]] which has the reverse effect of granting them [[Maat]].

It caters to the children of the wealthy and powerful, known as the [[Aurum]].  While multiple scientific studies and pursuits are encouraged within the University; the largest and most well funded wing of the school is dedicated to [[The Medica]].  [[The Medica]] have unlocked and perfected the concept of [[Galvanism]]; which allows control over life and death, extending life through a process known as [[The Sacrement]].  This process is so intricate and secret that only the wealthy [[Aurum]] can afford it.  This control over life and death makes the University unfathomably rich and powerful.

!Faculty
| [img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/petra-bach-andralli-portrait.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Petra Bach Andralli]] |[[Doctor]] [[Petra Bach Andralli]] is the [[Headmistress]] of The University, and holds power in [[Tszanthus]] for her and her [[Medica's|The Medica]] knowledge of the use of an [[Envoy]] to extend life for the wealthy [[Aurum]] of the city.  She herself is a wealthy [[Aurum]] and oversaw the augmentation and design of her own body.  She also oversees [[The Crockery]] and allows those with enough money to experiment her inmates. |
| [img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/anbrosio-abanto-portrait.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Anbrosio Abanto]] |[[Doctor]] [[Anbrosio Abanto]] is the [[Dean]] of [[Azlantology|Azlant]], Anthropology, and Archeology at the University and the Curator of [[The Museum Of Natural History]].  His lifelong obsession is to find [[Divinity's Root]], a [[First Age|The First Age]] artifact.  He is pompous and cruel to his students. |

!Members
| [img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/cassee-dannell-portrait.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Cassee Dannell]] |[[Doctor]] [[Cassee Dannell]] is a graduate of Baldarrain University, having studied under [[Doctor]] [[Anbrosio Abanto]] in the field of Anthropology.  [[Cassee|Cassee Dannell]] is timid and nervous around people, who comes alive when in the throws of a complicated scholarly issue.  She can be quick to defend fringe theories, and does not bring the same air of sophistication that those in the University often look for; causing her to have lost most credibility with her peers. |
| [img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/alda-arkin-portrait.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Alda Arkin]] |[[Doctor]] [[Alda Arkin]] is an aged former professor of Anthropology for the University.  He was granted the honorific position of Curator of [[The Museum Of Natural History]] for a single day, before he was disgraced by the theft of [[The Murkmire Stone]].  He was stripped of his role of Curator, and forced into a disgraced retirement.  He is considered too trustful of others, and oblivious to the reality that surrounds him; many of his peers consider him foolish and naive.  Many of his theories concerning the anthropology and archeology of [[Kellos]] and [[Amon]] have proven to be disastrously wrong and based upon pure fantasy.  |

!Former Members
| [img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/erasmus-baldarrain-portrait.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Erasmus Baldarrain]] |[[Doctor]] [[Erasmus Baldarrain]] was considered the pioneer and founder of the principles that posthumously grew into Balderrain University.  He perfected the research of [[Galvandra]], and pushed the boundaries of conventional understanding to unlock the ability to forestall the aging process.  While many questioned his ethics, his contributions shaped the modern understanding of [[The Sacrement]] used so widely among the [[Aurum]] of [[The Hegemony]]. |

<pre>[&gt;img[images/bestiary/banderhobb.jpg]]
A Banderhobb is a creation of dark and twisted [[Blood Magic]], born of blood and corruption.  It has the form of a giant bipedal toad that exists to serve its creator.  During its brief existence, a Banderhobb attempts to carry out its master's bidding.  It accomplishes its mission with no concern for the harm it suffers or creates, its only desire is to serve and succeed.  A Banderhobb that is assigned to track down a target is particularly dangerous when it is provided with a lock of hair, a personal belonging, or other object connected to the target.  Possession of such an item will allow it to sense the creature's location from as far as a mile away.  It fulfills its duties until its existence ends.  When it expires it leaves behind only a black goo and wisps of shadow.

!Personality
Banderhobbs hold no emotions such as hatred, jealousy, spite or ego.  At the same time, no action they commit was based in kindness, respect, or adoration.  Emotions are an alien concept to the Banderhobb mind and even urges such as hunger or sleep are not things they desire or need.  The truly terrifying aspect of a Banderhobb is their complete apathy to their situation, striving only to complete the mission assigned to them.  This makes Banderhobbs impossible to manipulate or persuade.
Thinking of Banderhobbs as unthinking soldiers, however, is a grave mistake.  Its absolute obedience should not be misconstrued as mindlessness; it is able to make logical assessments without impule or emotion impeding its thinking.  Both cunning and incredibly aware, a Banderhobb can make swift tactical decisions and even decide to retreat if it believed that was the most efficient path to completing its task.
They are known to have a deep understanding of their master's needs, recognizing idoms metaphors, dialects and otherwise reading into the non-literal meaning of commands.</pre>

<pre>|Governor:|[[Ariel Eulien]], [[Shield]] of Bandor, [[Marshall]] of [[The Green Sea]] and head of [[House Eulien]]|
|Population:|No census or taxes exist, but estimations are 23,500 to 30,000.  All races co-exist here|
|Fortifications:|50 mounted men are the local standing police force.  The police force is made up exclusively of volunteers.  They are usually well armed and armored, even when on patrol of the city.  They are often in plate and full helmet, and wield horseman’s flails, swords, and clubs.  A militia of 600 can be mustered in times of great need, mostly semi-trained citizens.  Bandor relies on its extreme wealth and influence, often ‘renting’ garrisons from nearby cities, or mercenary groups when serious defense is called for.  No city walls exist|
|Law:|Loose.  Trading would go elsewhere if the local laws were strict, so nearly anything goes.  No killing, no disrupting trading, everything else goes.|
|Resources:|Bandor is famous for its money lending, mercenaries, wagon repairs, riding mounts, and a thick black beer known as [[Bandorian Black Ale]].  However, they possess no self-sustaining resources.  The city trades for all necessary supplies.|

!Description
Bandor began as a trading hub, and eventually grew enough to be permanent.  In 1775 [[IO]] it was the home of [[The Republican Senate|The Old Republic]], and was the center of government control until the government moved to [[Deepwater]]. Currently, the town is home to many nightclubs, dancehalls, taverns and other wild forms of entertainment.  Nearly every carnal desire can be fulfilled in Bandor.  The town gets rather rowdy at night.  The city was founded near the broken ruins of the [[Elvish city|The Sylvan Empire]] of [[Velefanaefe]].

[[The Gauntlet]] is a group of [[Sellswords|Sellsword]] headquartered in Bandor.  [[House Eulien]] welcomes [[The Gauntlet]] within their city, due to the level of protection the group offers the city.  In times of need [[The Gauntlet]] will act as police or militia, at a very high cost to the city.  They are also known for guard duty of merchant caravans, or as personal bodyguards to the rich or nobility.

[[The Amphitheater]] is a central attraction to all who visit Bandor.  It is host to various forms of public entertainment such as plays or musical performances.  Most often talked about is the gladiatorial combats that are fought here.  The combats are held on the 10th day of every month.  Many attend, and the gambling is as savage as the fighting.

The city of Bandor mints a coin known as the [[Bandorian Thumb|BandorianThumb]] (also known as simply thumbs, or coppers).  The thumb is the lowest denomination of [[Currency]] in the realm, due the sheer amount of coins the city has minted in the past.

!Social Customs
*It is customary for the citizens of Bandor to be extravagant.  Expensive jewelry and clothing are worn by even the poorest fisherman.  The Extravagance of the townsfolk is so extreme, that even local shops offer free sweets to all who browse (often raising their prices to accommodate).  Those that actually are at the top of the social ladder do not dress to impress, not wanting to be caught up with the customs of the lower class.  Instead they dress rather modestly.   Their clothes are made from the finest cloths and silks, but they lack the over the top flair favored by the small-folk.

While designer name brand fashions are still a relatively new concept, it is the latest fad to wear clothing made by [[Jaskis|Kennan Jaskis]] herself.  [[Kennan Jaskis]] has taken her new role of fashion tycoon very seriously, and her elitist attitude makes her hard to tolerate in large doses.|

!Places Of Interest
*[[The Yellow Lion]] is well known for terrible food, watered down ale, and its excellent source for gossip and information.
*[[The Drunken Dwarf]] is a tavern that feels more like a cave than a building.  This is mainly due to the Dwarven proprietor.  He is as rough and jagged as his patrons, and normally joins in on any bar fights.  He always appears to be drinking more than his customers.
*[[The Dancing Bear]] is full of scantily clad dancing girls.  Here one can enjoy a good mug of [[Bandorian Black Ale]] while watching some of the most beautiful girls in Bandor dance.
*[[The Red Beard]] is named after its proprietor, [[Harlyn Bergun]].  He was once famous for being the best archer in [[Asha]] – who regulars say hasn’t lost his touch.
*[[The Amphitheater]] is the last of the [[Elvish ruins|The Sylvan Empire]] that stood here.  It is currently used for performances and public entertainment.
*[[The Order’s Rest]] is a inn and restaurant founded by [[Bishop]] [[Malar Ralm]].  This establishment is very tame and boring compared to the atmosphere in the rest of Bandor.  The serving girls here show the least amount of skin, and no rough housing is tolerated.  The patrons are watched carefully, and the proprietor (a local priest) is known to give sermons to all those forsaken souls that call this place dull

!Adventuring Hooks
''Victory Breakout'' - Several monsters are freed from their confines in [[The Ampitheater]].  These monsters - an [[Abominable Yeti|Yeti]], a [[Hydra]], and a [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]], and others tear through the streets leaving carnage in their wake.  Did these monsters escape by themselves or did someone else free them to distract the guard and characters while another crime took place?</pre>

The first [[Human]] minted coin was the Bandorian Thumb.  The thumb is made of copper, and bears the official seal of [[Bandor]] (an open hand) on both of its faces.  The thumb’s official name is the ‘Bandorian Copper Piece’, however it receives its common name due to its low value and extremely high circulation.

The Barguul (translated as &quot;Shadow&quot; in [[Black Speech]]) are creatures made of shadow that live in [[The Shadowfell]].  They are evil entities that have weakness against light - and have the ability to possess living creatures and use them like a puppet.

Barnabus Diggle is a [[Professor]] at [[The Athenaeum]] who teaches [[Cantrips|Cantrip]] to all of the new first year students.  He is an extremely old [[Half-Elf]] at over 170 years of age, and his age has made him incompetent in anything other than the most simple spells (However Barnabus sees himself as important, and does not see the opinion others have of him).  He is hard of hearing, bad of sight, and many first year students end up taking advantage of his kindness and leniency.

Barnabus's [[Wizard|Wizardry]] [[Familiar]] was an owl he named [[Maximus]], who faded away back to [[The Feywild]] over 70 years ago.

As a young student in [[The Athenaeum]], Barnabus had a friend named [[Fenwick Vendergeist]], a fellow [[Half-Elf]] who still lives within the city of [[Zylok]].  The two stay in constant contact, using spells to chat with each other every night.  As a young lad, Barnabus was quite the athlete.  He broke two school records as captain of a [[Spellflag]] team, and a plaque of his achievement still stands in [[The Library Of The Athenaeum]] - much to the student's amazement.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/gods/false-gods/basha-dadan.jpg]]
!Unknown Background
Not much is known about Basha Dadan and where he came from before rising to the ranks of an [[Apotheon]].  He is the most disciplined of the [[Apotheons|Apotheon]] in mind, body and spirit; having long since shed his need for material things well before his apotheosis.  He is thought to have been one of the first [[Apotheons|Apotheon]] to ascend, having attained his position without the assistance of [[Qualok]] / [[Vegvisir]].  Even to [[Vegvisir]], Basha Dadan is a mystery.

!The Vow Of Silence
While little is known about his past, it is known that Basha Dadan took a vow of silence while in his mortal form.  This vow has carried forward into [[godhood|Apotheon]] and he is known to have only spoken a handful of words since taking his vow.  While he is stoic and disciplined, he does allows himself to smile at humor.  Only one [[Apotheon]] has been known to be able to make him lose control and laugh, [[ElethaNori]].

!The Miracles of Basha Dadan
During his ascension to [[Apotheon]], Basha Dadan wrought three miracles.  He used these three miracles to sever the remaining mortal connections he held.  First he erased his physical self from [[Asha]], Second the mental connections he had with friends and relatives, and Third the spiritual connections he made throughout his life.  This erased all knowledge of his mortal existence, even to himself.  This act, in his mind, was his final step to reach full enlightenment and guide the mortal realm without any attachments.  In this way, he is regarded as the most powerful [[Apotheon]], closer to [[godhood|The Gods]] than [[Vegvisir]] himself.</pre>

<div title="Beholder" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202112270014" modified="202211211444" tags="aberration creature" changecount="7">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/bestiary/beholder.jpg]]

A beholder, sometimes called an eye tyrant, is a large aberration from [[The Abyss]].  These round beings have ten eyestalks and one central eye, each capable of powerful innate [[Magic]].  They have no other appendages, and levitate and fly at will.  They are powerful and intelligent, and left unchecked could be a great threat to [[Asha]].

!Biology
Beholders are instantly recognizable, being a floating sphere with a single eye, ten wriggling eyestalks, and giant maw filled with razor sharp teeth.  They are known to grow as large as 10 feet in diameter, but larger sizes are thought possible as they appear to grow to fit their environment over time.  Skin color varies, with purple, blue and red being the most prevalent.
Due to their many eyes, beholders have the ability to see in all directions, making them difficult to ambush.  Their eyes have the ability to see in all but magical darkness, but can not discern color.

!Psychology
Beholders house more than one brain, and are essentially multiple entities in a single body.  This causes a beholder to be naturally schizophrenic, with a predisposition of xenophobia, megalomania, rage, and acts of violence.  Generally, their [[Abyssal|The Abyss]] origin warps their psyche with hunger for wealth and power above others.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/baator/stygia/belphagor.jpg]]
Belphagor, Dark Tyrant of [[The Gazath Throne]], Lord of [[Arnadoth]], Duke of [[The Circle Of Chains|Stygia]].

Belphagor is an utterly selfish entity that has an insatiable desire for advancement in the power hierarchy of [[Baator]].  He is [[Feytouched]]; half [[Fey]] and half [[Dathairä]] - a product of [[A Hag Breeding Program|The Quicksilver Program]].  Armed with both the [[Magic]] of the [[Hags|Hag]] and the cruelty of the [[Dathairä]] he is ruthless and unrelenting in his pursuit of power, but indifferent towards power and privilege once actually obtained.  He makes deals solely for the purpose of profit and gain and otherwise doesn't care about the results of the exchange.  Belphagor is a megalomaniac, which causes friction with other [[Dathairä]].  He is hated by his kind for his unending schemes.

He is a master of transfiguration and is fond of taking forms of other beings.

!The Circle Of Chains
Belphagor's crowning achievement was becoming the Duke of [[The 5th Layer Of Baator|Stygia]], [[Stygia]].  Here he presides over [[Baator's|Baator]] prison which hold the enemies of [[Azarad-Ji]] and [[Dathairä]] who require punishment.  As warden, he is privy to information and secrets which grant him a level of power unachievable by others of his kind.  He covets this information, keeping it for himself.  He is so protective of this information, that he kills his underlings without hesitation in order to keep confidentiality.

!Hostile Takeover
Belphagor overthrew the prior [[Duke]] of [[Stygia]], [[Drazgazel]], by breaking into [[The Prison Of Ash]] and masquerading as a tortured soul.  [[Drazgazel]] was complacent, and soon found himself locked within a prison of his own making.

!Relationships
Despite being one of the Lords of [[Baator]], Belphagor has very few allies.  The other [[Lords Of The Nine|The Lords Of The Nine]] distrust him and they treat him with suspicion and scorn.

!The Quicksilver Program
Belphagor is a product of [[The Quicksilver Program]], raised by the [[Hag]] [[Melusina]], who he thinks of as a mother.  He has [[Melusina]] locked away within [[The Citadel Of Arnadoth]] in [[Stygia]], where he tortures and manipulates her into providing more information on his creation and birth.  Unbeknownst the [[The Hags|Hag]], he is nearly an [[Archfey]] - capable of leading them back to [[The Feywild]].

!History
In 1021 [[AAP]], one of Belphagor's minions created a binding agreement with the [[Human]] [[Ulan Nailo]].</pre>

<pre>For more details of the currency of [[Asha]], see [[Currency]]

The Black Pearl is the name of the currency of the [[Elves|Elf]] of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  They are small round pebble-like stones with a glossy black finish, and an engraved [[Elvish]] rune signifying the [[city|Cities Of The Sylvan Empire]] it was minted in.  The material that comprises the stone is unknown, and the art of the minting technique is lost.  These stones are extremely old, dating back to soon after [[The Elvish Awakening]].  No matter their age, all Black Pearls look as if they were minted yesterday.  No deterioration is apparent and they are essentially indestructible.  It is very rare to find Black Pearls in circulation due to how much they are prized and hoarded by the rich.  The existing [[elves|Elf]] will have nothing to do with their currency from their past, and are actually reviled by it.  All money is considered taboo to both [[Elven|Elf]] cultures, and their societies trade exclusively with barter.</pre>

|![[Click Here For Information on the Corruption|Corruption]]|
Blood Magic is a skill that can be taught and learned, even easier than [[Wizardry]].  While the more powerful rituals are delicate and fickle, some rituals are easy enough to be followed like a recipe.  However for most, the practice of Blood Magic is not only considered dangerous, but evil and abhorent - as many of the rituals require great sacrifice to feed the desired outcome.  Performing and participating in Blood Magic rituals brings about [[Corruption]], which can take a great physical toll on the body and mind.

!Formulas
While anyone can attempt to cast Blood Magic rituals, the process is fraught with peril.  The strange and intricate incantations draw energy from within the very life essence found within living creatures; or in some cases the very essence of the caster themselves.  Blood Magic formulas and recipes utilize science and mathematics beyond the capacity of mortal understanding.  These formulas are held only in shunned books and in the minds of dangerous eccentrics who know more than is safe about the secrets of reality.  Generally, these spells depend upon knowledge of [[The Elder Gods]], extradimensional mathematics, and incomprehensible iconography of the cosmic forces underlying the universe.

Successfully completing a Blood Magic ritual is not an easy feat, and there are multiple chances for the casting to go wrong.  These failures can weaken the caster or even unleash horrors upon the world.  Even when successfully performed, each ritual has a price.  Casting Blood Magic incantations can cause some of the energy remaining residual behind within the caster.  This residual energy begins to manifest itself as [[Corruption]].  While this [[Corruption]] may unlock new understanding and insight on the fundamentals of Blood Magic, it more often bombards ones body with afflictions from which most mortals can't survive.

!Alchemy
[[Alchemy]] is one of the oldest and lesser forms of Blood Magic.  Many [[Alchemical|Alchemy]] recopies may even be performed without fear of [[Corruption]] if the [[Alchemist|Alchemy]] is trained to first distill the essence from the living things they use as components.  This not only requires skill and talent, but access to the correct tools and equipment.</pre>

!Description
Brand is an ancient city, even predating the founding of [[The Viridian Empire]].  It stands next to a significant waterfall in [[The Kelerion River]], and straddles the cliff face with ports on both the upper and lower sections of the river.  A mechanical elevator allows cargo to be shifted between ports, making Brand a bustling city that acts as a trading hub for [[The Stone Lands]].  Resources from [[Skoras]], [[Dorin's Mine]], [[Hillcrest]] and [[The Dales]] are brought to Brand to make their way to [[The Fisher's League]] and then out to sea.  Brand is an ever expanding city, with a new section built across the river connected by a bridge that is considered to be one of the most monumental undertakings of the modern age.  Directly outside of the walls are the villages of [[Pyxis]] and [[Gramm]].

!Social Customs
* Each year the founding of Brand is celebrated.  All of the commoners in the city drink, and partake in a contest known as [[The Battle Of The Boasts]].
* The wealthy in the city build their villas in a square, such that the center is open to the sky.  Inside is traditionally a garden and pool.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/organizations/tszanthus/breagan-datha.jpg]]
Above all gangs of [[The Council Of Thieves]] within the city of [[Tszanthus]] is the Breagan Datha (&quot;The bargainers of death&quot; in [[Elvish]]).  They are an exclusive organization that many believe is more myth than reality.  All other gangs are amateurs compared to the stories of the exploits of the Breagan Datha.  Skilled rogues and assassins, no member identifies themselves as belonging to the organization when they aren’t working, and nobody has ever lived to see a Breagan Datha member on the job without them wearing their signature porcelain skull mask.  Like silent whispers they get in and get out, and are said to only take the biggest most lucrative jobs.  Even those in the know wonder if Breagan Datha is real or just the name of a boogeyman to keep the other rogues in check.

!Exclusive To The Draugaira
Membership is tightly controlled, with the only members being [[Draugaira]] [[Elves|Elf]] who found a home here in [[Ruje]] after the fall of [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]].  Their homeland ravaged by war, they carved out an existence in [[Tszanthus]] and have prospered.

!Members
| [img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/eirethula-portrait.jpg][Eirethula]]  [[Eirethula]] |__[[Eirethula]]__ (&quot;Sea Spring&quot;) was once a loyal supporter of the former guild master [[Ethufeara]], and under his tutelage was as carefree and content as her namesake.  However after [[Shaarlaima]] assumed control of Breagan Datha, she became psychologically broken; a shell of her former self.  She saw [[Ethufeara]] as a father figure, and has become cynical and jaded in his absence.  Where once she had a moral compass, she has reluctantly embraced [[Shaarlaima's|Shaarlaima]] tactics.

//You can certainly try. ''- Brian Disbrow''//
}}}

Brian Disbrow, also known as &quot;The First Sage&quot;, was a [[Human]] that lived during [[The First Age]], gifted with the power of [[Foretelling]].  While many of his visions on the fate of [[Asha]] and the [[Cosmos|The Planes Of Existence]] were flawed, there was much he got right.  He was largely unaware of the power in his visions, using the information he gleaned for his own amusement and games.

!The Birth Of Asha
Brian weaved tales of [[Asha]], tales of danger and tales of intrigue; but most of all epic tales of heroism.  Along with his family and friends, they explored the mysteries of the universe and saved it from [[Desecration]] time and time again.  The first conception of [[Asha]] was in 1999, when Brian and his friend [[Jeremy Berse]] spent hours imagining tales of [[Asha's|Asha]] birth.  The [[Larabira]] was formed, and the fall of [[The Sylvan Empire]] at the hands of the [[Kiraga]].

In the first adventure, [[Jeremy Berse]] led Brian Disbrow, [[Erin Disbrow]], and [[Venesa Berse]] through a mystery in [[Laranor]] during [[The First Light's Hope]] - Brian played the fledgling [[Wizard|Wizardry]], [[Artimas Meliger]].  Kicked out of [[The Athenaeum]] and seeking learning through more unconventional means.

Only a small handful of stories and adventures were had with the group until it was shelved; but Brian couldn't stop thinking about [[Asha]].  Over the many years, he continued in his own time to explore it's many lands and people.  He wrote down notes and stories about what he had envisioned, first on scraps of paper then in an electronic document until eventually forming a structured [[Wiki]].

When his children were born, he knew how much he wanted to share the world of [[Asha]] with them.  As soon as they were old enough, he shared tales of the [[Elves|Elf]], [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] and [[Gods|The Gods]] that inhabited [[Asha]].  When they came of age, they added to the stories as well, making it even more full of life than Brian could have ever dreamed.  It was a campaign with [[The Grey Companions]] that really sparked the creativity - all of those decades of exploring [[Asha]] paid off in a set of stories that brought [[Erin Disbrow]], [[Tyler Disbrow]] and [[Elizabeth Disbrow]] tears of sorrow and loss, cheers of accomplishment and daring, and astonishment at the wonder of this mystical world.</pre>

The [[Kell]] believe that there are those among them that walk in shadows, and dance in the night.  They refer to these creatures as Burgonya.  While just stories the old wives tell the children, every story is similar.  Sightings of half-man half-animal forms that prey on hapless [[Humans|Human]].  They are grotesque to the eye and nose, have strength and speed beyond normal abilities.

The stories also say that the Burgonya lead normal healthy lives in the light of the sun.  Only on special nights will a person transform into a bestial Burgoya.  Often the Burgonya will not even know of his bestial form.  Their evil disease grants them unholy rest while in their beast form.

The tales commonly tell of wolf forms, but other rare stories can be found with Bear, Seal, Leopard, Boar, Ape, and Bat Burgonya.

Finally, the Kells tell of the Burgonya’s infectious bite.  It is said that those bitten by a Burgonya will themselves become one, or if one is lucky, they will die.</pre>

The Bushyasta is a giant lumbering creature found in [[Orcish Lands]].  It has a bony wedge shaped head, with small beady eyes protected by armored plates that run from the brow ridge down the spine to the short tail.  It has large claws and is an avid digger, loosening the hard soil with claws and using its large shovel head to scoop and move the earth.  It is nocturnal, spending the majority of its time buried beneath the earth.

They are slow moving and typically ambush predators disguising themselves as a small hill or boulder.  Bushyasta can go a long duration without food or water.

Caldoria was a continent that existed up until [[The Second Desecration]], comprised mainly of reclusive [[Dragonborn]] and their [[Tabaxi]] slaves.  Before the events of [[The Second Desecration]] the [[Dragonborn Elders]] witnessed a foul taint spreading across [[Asha]] - a world ending calamity that caused them to protect [[Caldoria]] from destruction. Using powerful [[Magic]] long forgotten, they submerged their major cities beneath the ocean where they believed the touch of [[Desecration]] could not reach.  [[Dragonborn]] civilization lived undisturbed and isolated for countless years under magical domes that kept the dark cold water at bay - until [[The Lifting]] in 1021 [[AAP]] where the cities returned to the surface of the ocean.

Cities of Caldoria include [[Anmanu]], [[Kunusut]], [[Annofu]], [[Sasu]], [[Ekru]], [[Nekkhapata]], and [[Ansapis]].  Each of the cities are on interconnected islands with the exception of [[Anmanu]] which floats high above in the sky propelled by ancient [[Magic]].

[[The Guardian Of Caldoria]] is a large lobster shaped leviathan that lives beneath the ocean surrounding the islands.  It is ancient in design and construction - a mix of metal and flesh similar to the process undergone by [[The Children Of The Forge]]</pre>

!Description
Candlekeep is known by several names, one of which is &quot;The Floating City&quot; in [[The Polité Of Bronze]].  This is due to the fact that the city consists of over 100 small islands connected by numerous canals and bridges.  Some of the buildings are built upon wooden platforms that are supported by stakes driven underwater to reinforce the construction.  There are tensions between the local inhabitants and a large group of refugees from [[Caldoria]] that are comprised of [[Tabaxi]].  The [[Tabaxi]] do not know the language and are poor, surviving by roaming the streets and living within dark alleys.

!Social Customs
* [[Panathenaea]] - is celebrated each year to honor the harvest and [[Umwe]].  The local [[Sorcerer|Sorcery]] [[Endymion Traxigor]] has elevated the holiday by offering trinkets to the locals in place of animal sacrifice.  This holiday is held above all others within the city of Candlekeep.

!Notable Characters and Groups
| [&gt;img[images/characters/amon/bronze/anders-quinticius-solmar-portrait.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Anders Quinticius Solmar]] |[[Anders Quinticius Solmar]] is a the richest [[Patriar]] within the city.  His family moved from [[Heliopolis]] two generations ago.  [[Anders|Anders Quinticius Solmar]] is the sole surviving heir to his family's fortune.  He often carries a cane that hides a thin Rapier.  He he betrothed to [[Carmila Volkos]], a marriage of convenience rather than love.  He has an air of formality about him that causes others around him to be formal as well.  He owns the largest fleet of shipping and fishing vessels within [[The Risen Reef]].  An [[Elvish|Elf]] manservant named [[Driane'eire]] served his family for generations.  But during [[Panathenaea]] in 1025 [[AAP]], the [[Draugaira]] [[Elf]] murdered three members of [[The Remnant]] and was seen no more.|
| [&gt;img[images/characters/amon/bronze/carmila-volkos-portrait.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Carmila Volkos]] |[[Carmila Volkos]] is the wife of [[Anders Quinticius Solmar]] and the daughter of [[Eliander Volkos]], a rich [[Patriar]] from [[Heliopolis]].  She is beautiful, slender, and skilled at playing a shy innocent girl who needs others for support.  In truth, she is cunning, manipulative, and lusts for power and control.  [[Carmila Volkos]] likes to do what she wants, when she wants - and knows she can always wriggle away from trouble with her looks, her status, or her money.  [[Blood Magic]] intrigues her, although she is careful in it's use as she knows it may damage her greatest asset: her appearance.|
| [&gt;img[images/characters/amon/bronze/endymion-traxigor-portrait.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Endymion Traxigor]] |__[[Endymion Traxigor]]__ is a local eccentric [[Sorcerer|Sorcery]] that lives in a small and simple hut within [[The Candlekeep Prominade]].  He can be seen roaming the town causing minor mischief with his servant, [[Avidar]].  He is adored by the townsfolk as much as he is tolerated.  While [[Endymion Traxigor]] often causes trouble, his heart is in the right place and he means well.  His full power in [[Magic]] is unknown, but it must be significant if he has permanently transformed himself into the body of a [[Beaver]].|
| [&gt;img[images/characters/amon/bronze/vibius-castinus-portrait.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Vibius Castinus]] |[[Vibius Castinus]] is a minor [[Patriar]] within the city.  He makes his riches off of the manufacture and distribution of soap.  He is a nemesis of [[Endymion Traxigor]], who he dislikes as the [[Beaver]] often gets his hair in his soap products.  [[Endymion Traxigor]] is unaware that [[Vibius Castinus]] dislikes him so - and often speaks fondly of their friendship. [[Vibius Castinus]] is a large man that always smells of lavender and sweet fragrance. |

!Places Of Interest
* [[The Candlekeep Prominade]] - a woodland park in the center of the city that many go to for relaxation.  A small stream runs through the area and is dammed up by [[Endymion Traxigor]] who has a small home inside the simple dam.  Most locals avoid his house, but enjoy their time in [[the park|The Candlekeep Prominade]].
* [[The Argyris Forrest]] - there is not much known about [[The Argyris Forrest]], as once inside the tangled woodland you find yourself lost before emerging from the place you entered void of memory.  Everyone knows to stay away, as ancient [[Magic]] guards the Forrest.
* [[The Seminarcana]] - is a towering library fortress that stands on a crag overlooking [[The Risen Reef]].  It contains a large sum of knowledge collected and curated by individuals known as [[The Affirmed]].  They live and work within the library, carefully tending to the knowledge within.  Those who do not live within the city often misinterpret [[The Seminarcana]] as &quot;The Candlekeep&quot;, when Candlekeep is actually the name of the city in which it resides.  The symbol of the library is a castle emblazoned over a flame.  Entry is restricted and those that are let in are required to give a book for entry.
* [[The Short Gentleman]] - is a modest inn with the [[Dwarf]] [[Gerkyl Jadebraid]] as proprietor.  Despite the modest furnishings, he runs the place with great demeanor and class, treating all that arrive as [[Patriar]].</pre>

Carmila Volkos (1000 [[AAP]] - Current) is the wife of [[Anders Quinticius Solmar]] and the daughter of [[Eliander Volkos]], a rich [[Patriar]] from the city of [[Heliopolis]]. She is beautiful, slender, and skilled at playing a shy innocent girl who needs others for support. In truth, she is cunning, manipulative, and lusts for power and control.

[[Blood Magic]] intrigues her, although she is careful in it's use as she knows it may damage her greatest asset: her appearance.

!Personality
Carmila Volkos is fiercely protective of her position and reputation, and understands how fragile it can be.  She puts on an appearance in which she lives a storybook life, throwing parties and catering to the poorest of the [[Patriar]].  Secretly, she is disgusted by the people of [[Candlekeep]], thinking them small and backwater compared to her home in [[Heliopolis]].  Carmila is popular, and others often overlook her seemingly innocent disrespect which she cunningly interjects into conversations for her own amusement.  She is fixated on being the center of attention, and has a flair for dramatics.

!A Marriage Of Convenience
She married [[Anders Quinticius Solmar]] not for love, but for convenience.  As he is the richest [[Patriar]] of [[Candlekeep]], his wealth and position are able to sustain her lavish lifestyle.  Carmila doesn't dislike [[Anders|Anders Quinticius Solmar]], and even finds his gentleness charming on rare occasions; warming up to his generous personality.</pre>

Carrion Crawlers resemble large pale yellow or green centipedes, roughly the size of a grown man.

Carrion Crawlers lay their eggs in piles of waste, which hatch in the hundreds and quickly consume one another, limiting the suitability of the offspring.</pre>

[[Doctor]] Cassee Dannell (998 [[AAP]] / 1240 [[Hassomir]] - Current) is a somewhat enigmatic figure in the world of academia in the city of [[Tszanthus]] on the continent of [[Ruje]].  From a young age, she displayed an insatiable curiosity about the world and its many enigmas.  Growing up in the bustling city of [[Tszanthus]], Cassee was drawn to the city's rich history and diverse cultures.  Her academic journey began as a student of the prestigious [[Baldarrain University]] where she studied the mysterious and elusive field of anthropology and archeology.  While she showed a tremendous amount of talent, it soon became clear that Cassee's approach to her chosen field was far from conventional.

!Guided By Unconventional Wisdom
Cassee found herself under the tutelage of the brilliant [[Doctor]] [[Anbrosio Abanto]], who was notorious for his obsession with proving the fable of the lost city of [[Azlant]].  While [[Doctor]] [[Abanto|Anbrosio Abanto]] was cruel to his students, Cassee was able to persevere and assist in some key research that provided clues to a precursor culture that led credence to the [[Azlant]] mythos.  This unconventional path led her to explore other hidden mysteries and engage in fringe hypotheses that blurred the lines of fairy tale and reality.

!Fringe Theories
''The Ethereal Veil'' - Cassee delved into the concept of an ethereal veil that separates the living world from the realm of spirits and the afterlife.  She theorized that this veil was not impenetrable and that spirits of the deceased could sometimes breach it, crossing into the world of the living.  Cassee's research involved studying accounts of ghostly encounters and near death experiences.  She has since abandoned this research and line of thinking.

''The Hidden Societies Of The Undercity'' - Fascinated by the [[Undercity]] of [[Tszanthus]], Cassee hypothesized that vast cultures existed beneath the city.  Hidden societies, ancient cults, and forgotten rituals taking place beneath the bustling streets.

''Extraterrestrial Influences'' - Cassee believes that early civilizations of [[Asha]] had contact with extraterrestial beings, suggesting the origins of [[Human]] culture may have began out in the stars.</pre>

The Catoblepas is native to the vile swamplands of [[Caldoria]].  It is a large lumbering beast resembling a cross between a [[Yak]], [[Buffalo]] or [[Warthog]] found in other parts of [[Asha]].  It is content in lazily wallowing in its marshy home, munching on vegetation and carrion.  It is roughly the size of two [[Horses|Horse]] with a bloated hairy body like a [[Buffalo]].  It has a long neck like a [[Giraffe]] and a head like a [[Warthog]] with yellowed tusks.

The [[Dragonborn]] of [[Caldoria]] have domesticated the creatures.  A dangerous proposition since Catoblepas have a noxious perpetual scent of death that can only be removed if it is regularly bathed.  The [[Dragonborn]] also blind the animal for their gaze causes necrotic damage.  This process of blinding the creature causes the domesticated Catoblepas to have cloudy milk colored eyes.  They use the creatures as beasts of burden to pull wagons and plow fields.</pre>

Caxton Loom (980 [[AAP]] - current) was a pirate of [[The Mummers]] within [[The Risen Reef]] of [[Amon]].  Known by the moniker &quot;The Mongrel&quot; due to his physicality.  Caxton was a [[Kell]] born in [[Kellos]] who found his way to [[The Risen Reef]] and joined [[The Mummers]] as a pirate.  His brutality was difficult to contain, and he was routinely chastised by [[The Salt King]] [[Garrad Stroud]] due to pushing the limits of the rules of [[The Mummers]].  In 1006 [[AAP]], Caxton was chastised for the final time; he killed [[Garrad Stroud]] and assumed the title of [[The Salt King]].  While [[Garrad Stroud]] was beloved like a grandfather to many in [[The Mummers]], Caxton saw him as weak and easily overpowered him.

As [[The Salt King]], Caxton Loom sought to abolish the code of [[The Mummers]]; he saw the rites of parley and the code of civility as antiquated.  Many of [[The Mummers]] took offense to these changes, and Caxton murdered them.  It was [[Rafail Kallides]] who eventually usurped him and returned [[The Mummers]] to their former glory.  After besting Caxton, [[Rafail Kallides]] used a [[Blood Magic]] ritual in 1010 [[AAP]] to remove Caxton's soul and place it into Caxton's son [[Whyenne Loom]] so as to ensure the child wouldn't grow up a tyrant like his father.  The husk of Caxton Loom served [[Rafail Kallides]] as his [[Zombie]] lapdog, loyal to him and as retribution for the damage he did to the culture of [[The Mummers]].  Runes tattooed across his face are remnants of the ritual which removed his [[Soul]].

In 1026 [[AAP]], Caxton's son [[Whyenne Loom]], bristling with the newfound powers of an [[Apotheon]] used his fledgling abilities to seek redemption within his father.  Seeing there was the potential for good inside of him, [[Whyenne|Whyenne Loom]] returned his soul and renounced his powers as an [[Apotheon]] such that he could spend the remaining days with Caxton and have the relationship they never were able to have; for Caxton was as terrible of a father in [[Whyenne's|Whyenne Loom]] youth as he was a [[Salt King]].  Together, they travel [[Asha]] and experience life with a newfound perspective.</pre>

A changeling can supernaturally adopt any face they like.  For some changelings, a new face is only a disguise.  For other changelings, a new face may reveal an aspect of their soul.
In their true form, changelings appear faded, their features almost devoid of detail.  It is rare to see a Changeling in this form, for a typical Changeling changes their shape the way others might change their clothes.  A casual shape - one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history - is called a mask.  A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again.  However, many Changelings develop identities that have more depth, crafting whole personas complete with histories and beliefs.

Are they evil/fomorian?  Do they need to suck the appearance from someone?

Maybe transform is an action in the Feywild, and a Short Rest in the Material plane?  Need to keep the size the same?

Dopplers (also called shifters, vexlings, mimics, doubles, imitators, or pavrats) are shapeshifters who can take the form of anyone or any beast they have encountered, provided it has a similar body weight. 
In natural form they look quite hideous – like bald, long-nosed and yellow-eyed midgets with elongated limbs, tongues, and noses; somewhat resembling a figurine molded out of dough. They rarely remain so, however – they can change into any being who they know and who does not differ from their size. They can copy so precisely that apart from appearance they acquire physical features (like voice), skills, mindset, and characteristic behaviors. To do all this they don't need any previous insightful observation, they do it instinctively. They also can change fragments of their bodies into clothes or equipment, like a sword or lute.
Their abilities have some limitations, however: shapeshifting is possible only if they do not touch silver, and any item created from their body changes into torn out flesh if it loses contact with the rest of a doppler.


Size: Medium or small
Speed: 30 feet
Changeling Instincts: Thanks to your connection to [[The Feywild]], you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion
Shapechanger: As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice.  You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex.  You can also adjust your height and weight and can change your size between Medium and Small.  You can make yourself appear as a member of another race.  You can't duplicate the appearance of an individual you've never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have.  Your clothing and equipment aren't changed by this trait.  You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.</pre>

<pre>The Cherubim are [[AstraKashira]] formed after the closing of [[The Divine Gate]] at the end of [[The Second Age]].  They have no living memory or experience with [[The Elysians|Elysian]], and have not known the embrace of [[Lucian]].  Unlike [[AstraKashira]] formed by [[Lucian]] herself, who long to hear from their creator, the Cherubim hear [[Lucian]] whisper in their ears the moment they awaken.

Cherubim are formed by the song of [[The Heavenly Chorus]].  It is the power of the [[Mortal Souls|Soul]] which comprise [[The Chorus|The Heavenly Chorus]] which sing the Cherubim into existence.  This is a very rare occurrence and beyond the comprehension of the [[AstraKashira]].  Seen as a blessing, the Cherubim are welcomed with open arms.  One [[AstraKashira]] feels bonded to the new Cherubim.  While the Cherubim enter the world fully formed and indistinguishable from other [[AstraKashira]] - the bond is similar to one of parent and child.  The [[AstraKashira]] cares for the Cherubim, protecting and nurturing them.</pre>

A Chuul is a crustacean-like beast common to [[Ruje]].  There are multiple breeds of the animal that comes in a variety of shapes and sizes.  Domesticated Chuul are often used in place of horse for hauling.  Their claws are large and powerful enough to snap a man's arm, however tame Chuul are docile and not known to harm anyone.  Chuul move at Chuul speed and cannot be coaxed to go faster.

The Chuul are better suited for the climate of [[Ruje]] than any other pack animal.  The dampness of the jungle climate is found to not be suitable to other beasts of burden found throughout [[Asha]].  The Chuul enjoy the moist air, and are native to the jungle and wetland conditions.</pre>

<pre>Clan Earthhammer is a [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] family clan who are the founders of the city of [[Kulkar]].  The members of this family are known to be honorable, compassionate, and adventurous.  It is often that members of this clan become adventurers, seek out fortune or heroic deeds.  It is thus that the family founded the city of [[Kulkar]].  In recent years, [[Eiddoel Earthhammer III]] has been changing the perception of the family.  He is ruthless, cunning, and stubborn.  He craves power, wealth, and status - not just for himself but for all of the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] of [[Kulkar]], making him a popular leader.

!Notable Members
[[Dargay Earthhammer]] was the crown prince of the clan, and joined [[The Grey Companions]] after an exile from his father.

The cockatrice is a grotesque lizard creature that resembles the head and feet of a bird, and the wings of a bat.  Their skin is reptilian in nature, with proto-feather protrusions.  It is famous for the venom found within its mouth.  Even the smallest scratch can spell doom, as once the venom makes contact with the bloodstream, the victim must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution save or be magically petrified.  On a failed save, they begin to turn to stone and are restrained, making another save.  On a successful save, the effect ends - on a failed save the victim is paralyzed for 24 hours.

Their diet consists of any small animals that can fit in its mouth, however they are fiercely territorial and aggressive.  They fly into the face of any threat, squawking and madly beating their wings as its head darts out to peck.</pre>

<pre>The Consul was the highest political office of [[The Old Republic]].  Two consuls were elected each year, serving together and possessing veto power over the others actions.  This lessened the ability for one factions to abuse the kingly powers this role bestowed upon them.  Election was performed by [[The Old Republic Senate]], who therefore would customarily elect a Consul from the ruling nobility.

The duties of the Counsul were to preside over [[The Old Republic Senate]], and see that the laws and decrees were carried out.  All other governmental roles were subordinate to the Consuls.  They also acted on behalf of the regions of [[Kellos]] in matters of state, such as negotiations with other nations such as [[Dwarf]] or [[Elf]].

In order to grant the Consul with greater authority at executing law, they had the power to summon, detain and arrest.  In times of great emergency, they had the authority to act on their own authority and responsibility.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/magic/corruption.jpg]]
Sustained contact with [[eldritch beings|The Elder Gods]] and locations, use of [[Blood Magic]], or other [[aberrant|Aberration]] actions cause a mortal [[Soul]] to take on corruption.  Corruption is like a virus, infecting the [[Soul]].  In small doses, this begins as madness and depravity; impulsiveness, hallucinations, paranoia or recklessness.  However, untreated corruption grows like a tumor mutating the physical form of a creature.

!Types Of Corruption
Corruption affects the [[Soul]] and body of living creatures, as well as the land itself.  The effects of corruption vary depending on the source, the intensity, and the duration of exposure, but they generally fall into the following categories:

| Mental Corruption | ? |
| Physical Corruption | ? |






!The Mutation

 
Fleshy
Virus
Contagious if you are near it a long time / exposure
eating it is bad / animals
corruption is alive
like a flesh spore
type of corruption is based upon the type of creature you got it from
invades dreams

[[Uridium]] - a slick, oily stone veined with blood like streaks.  physical corruption.

!Physical corruption of the land
When a physical location is corrupted, it is overcome with...   viscous substance.... living material.... psionically-sensitive and may be influenced and controlled by psionic entities. 

[[Promethean]]





!Corruption
Using Blood Magic frequently leaves traces of the powerful force inside of the user, granting them access to more powerful incantations but at a price.  Each [[Blood Magic Incantation|Blood Magic Rituals]] that is completed causes a Wisdom saving throw to be rolled.  The DC of this saving throw is outlined below, and is dependent on the character's current [[Corruption]] level and power of the incantation.  On a failure, the character suffers 1 point of Corruption.  When a new tier of corruption is achieved (e.g. Mild to Moderate, Moderate to Severe), roll a d12 on the [[Corruption]] Effects Table below to determine the effect of that character's [[Corruption]].  [[Corruption]] effects are cumulative with previous effects as higher tiers are achieved.  If a character reaches 12 or more [[Corruption]] points, the DM decides whether or not the character dies instantly, or goes insane and becomes an NPC under their control.  A character with 12 or more corruption points cannot be brought back to life or restored to player control until they are brought below 12 [[Corruption]] points.</pre>

CsaraAsha (c. 792 [[IO]] to 206 [[AAP]]) (&quot;To Yearn For Home&quot; in [[Elvish]]) was a [[Forana'loloKashira]] [[Elf]] who lived in the [[Haven|Havens]] of [[Numeneithela]].  She was the mother of [[ElethaNori]] and the wife of the powerful [[Shaman]] of [[The Stag Clan]] [[NeneHwesta]].

!The Art Of Tea
CsaraAsha held great importance to a tea set that had been handed down from generations in her family.  It originated from [[The Sylvan Empire]] when [[Elvish|Elf]] civilization was at its peak.  The culture of tea was ingrained within CsaraAsha's family, and she was a master at  [[Lysathira]], the art of tea.  Together with her good friend [[Cala]], they would continuously meet to keep the dying art alive.

!The Fields Of Kalara
In 203 [[AAP]], CsaraAsha felt the calling of [[The Fields Of Kalara]].  As her husband [[NeneHwesta]] was the tribe [[Shaman]], he did not feel the calling with her; so she bore this burden silently, wishing to spend a few more years with her love.  Her close friend, [[Cala]] warned that it was dangerous to hold on to mortal ties, and it was for the best to let go and return to [[The Mother|Valouria]].
As CsaraAsha came to peace with the idea of leaving, she was startled to learn she was pregnant with her first child, [[ElethaNori]].  Childbirth had become increasingly rare among the [[Elves|Elf]], and this was a blessing from [[The Mother|Valouria]] although at an inopportune time.  CsaraAsha gathered her strength to prolong her stay, enduring much pain and anguish as she had already waited longer than necessary.  She was fearful that she would not be able to hold out long enough for the birth to occur, a fear that came true.  As her spirit left for [[The Fields Of Kalara]], her husband [[NeneHwesta]] used powerful [[Blood Magic]] in order to save the premature baby. </pre>

[[Asha]] is abundant with different forms of currency and trade.  The [[wild nomadic tribesman of the northwestern territory|Kell]] use decorative strips of leather that they refer to as [[Cedula]]'s.  This simple form of currency is worthless outside of the [[nomadic people|Kell]] and is not recognized as a true currency of [[Asha]].  The [[Orcs]] are rumored to trade with teeth (taken from their fallen enemies).  Stranger still are the secluded island people of the western coast, who trade with small polished shells.  However, in the civilized lands only four major forms of currency are acknowledged: [[Bandorian “thumbs”|BandorianThumb]], [[Deepwater]] [[“Red Queens”|Red Queens]], [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] [[“Kombarian Eyes”|KombarianEye]], and Ancient [[Elven|Elf]] [[“Black Pearls”|Black Pearl]].

<pre>While colloquially the term &quot;Curse&quot; is used to apply to any hostile magic that has a harmful effect, from a technical point of view a true Curse is a dark charm that is derived from [[Blood Magic]].  True Curses are heinous and dark, meant to cause immense suffering; or even death.  It is possible for a practitioner to Curse an object, a person, or a place.  While minor Curses can be fleeting and temporary, more potent Curses are permanent and can affect large areas of land or a family line as it is passed down through heredity.

!Breaking A Curse
There are multiple means by which a curse can be broken or removed.  Most curses can be broken by killing the practitioner who uttered the Curse.  Other methods include Divine magic of an equal level of power to the Curse itself.  The individual who invoked the Curse may willingly remove it at any time, however may not be inclined to do so without proper payment.  Lastly, a strong Curse may have a trigger condition that causes the Curse to break upon its action; eg a spurned [[Warlock]] curses a princess to appear ugly to all that she loved, until she showed respect and love to all. </pre>

Cyril Viridian, (c. 61 [[IO]] - c. 11 [[AAP]]), was a Leader, Statesman, and [[Praetor]] and [[Consul]] of [[The Old Republic]].  [[Kellish|Kell]] blood flowed strong in his veins, being descended from the kings of [[The First Men]] to inhabit [[Kellos]].  He played a critical role in ending [[The Demon Plague]] and was outspoken against the perils of [[Magic]] and the impending doom of a [[Desecration]].

Was responsible for ending [[The Old Republic]] and establishing himself as [[Emperor]] of a new nation named [[The Viridian Empire]].  Once in power, he made swift social and governmental reforms - disbanding [[The Senate]], sponsoring the creation of [[The Divine Order]], changing the [[Calendar]], re-establishing hereditary rule, and most notably outlawing [[Magic]] through a move called [[Azutan Nagyos]], or &quot;War of the Mages&quot; in [[The Old Tongue]].

When the [[Azutan Nagyos]] ended, Cyril saw to the founding of [[The Magian Imperium]], a ruling body of mages who would set and enforce the laws on the use of [[Magic]] in the realms.</pre>

Cyrus Bryne is the official head of [[House Bryne]], [[Shield]] of [[Port Seamark]], and [[Marshall]] of [[The Coast]].  He is stern, ambitious, and politically astute.  Cyrus's goal is to see his [[house|House Bryne]] stronger and more powerful than he found it.

Cyrus has a familial relationship with the [[Emperor]] [[Jacob Jedaleon III]], in that Cyrus's aunt [[Freya Bryne]] was the [[Emeror's|Emperor]] mother.  At a young age, Cyrus was appalled that his cousin was treated special, as the only heir to the throne.  This grew to a silent rage due to an incident in which Cyrus was force to concede a contest of arms to his older cousin, as it would be unseemly to best the [[Prince]] [[Jacob Jedaleon III]].

Cyrus's mother [[Estrella Bryne]] was tough on Cyrus as a child.  She expected the best out of Cyrus, and was not against beating the child when her high standards were not met exactly.  Her punishments included kicking an 8 year old Cyrus out of the castle for days for defying her wishes, ruthlessly killing his pet falcon as a lesson for training it to be docile rather than a hunter, and commanding a teenage Cyrus to behead a criminal himself to understand his true duty and obligation as a [[Lord]].

Cyrus's father was a kind man who was simply the face of [[House Bryne]].  Everyone knew [[Estrella Bryne]] ruled the household.  His father died when Cyrus was 19, and his mother was quick to name him the head of [[House Bryne]].  Say what you must of [[Estrella Bryne]], but for her faults all she wanted was to see her son rule - and rule strongly.</pre>

Dargay (893 [[AAP]] - 1021 [[AAP]]) was a [[Dwarf]] warrior of [[Clan Earthhammer]], crown prince of [[Kulkar]], adventurer, and member of [[The Grey Companions]].  While often brooding and grumpy, Dargay had a soft spot for his close friends, as well as children.  He preferred action to diplomacy, which caused him trouble more often than not.

!Life In Kulkar
Dargay Earthhammer was a crown prince of [[Kulkar]], the eldest son of [[Dorn]] [[Eiddoel Earthhammer II]].  He excelled at martial skills, becoming the head of [[Kulkar's|Kulkar]] military in 928 [[AAP]].  When his father began to show signs of struggling with dementia, Dargay searched for and found [[The Lost Hall Of The Mad Dorn]] with the hopes of uncovering a cure (to no avail).  When he challenged his father to step down from the throne, Dargay was exiled in 932 [[AAP]].  He didn't speak to his father all of the years leading up to his father's death in 943 [[AAP]]; where Dargay's younger brother [[Eiddoel Earthhammer III]] assumed the throne.

!Exile
The life of wandering adventure suited Dargay.  He served as a sailor on a trading vessel that travelled to the reaches of [[Amon]] and back.  Rumors abounded that he defeated [[The Leviathan Of The Fey Waters]] with brilliant naval tactics and cunning.  After over 70 years in exile, Dargay aimed to return to speak to his brother and mend past wounds.  Along the way he stopped in the city of [[Brand]], where he was swept up in the chaos that was [[The Red Pox]].  By reflex, he found himself helping control the panicked citizens and bring order back to the streets.  For his heroism, self-sacrifice, and service he was named to [[The Grey Companions]] in his 112th year by [[Liam Mercer]] in 1005 [[AAP]]</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/bestiary/the-shadowfell/darkweaver.jpg]]
Dark Weavers are a species of colossal arachnid native to [[The Shadowfell]].  They are terrifying predators whose central torso can grow to the size of a cow, with legs that span 5 feet.  They are known for their cunning intelligence and lethal efficiency, making them one of the most efficient killers lurking within the shadows of [[The Shadowfell]].

Their bodies are covered in a thick, chitinous exoskeleton that ranges in color from deep obsidian black to shadowy grey, allowing them to blend seamlessly into their dark surroundings.  Their legs end in sharp, hooked claws that enable them to climb with ease.  Each leg is covered in bristling, coarse hairs that can sense the faintest vibrations in the air or ground, alerting them to the presence of potential prey.

Dark Weavers are known to weave their webs in strategic locations, often creating elaborate traps that funnel prey into a narrow corridor or pit.  They are patient hunters, waiting silently in the shadows for days or even weeks until the perfect moment to strike.  The webs themselves are also used as a means of communications between Dark Weavers, allowing them to send subtle vibrations to one another over long distances.  However, Dark Weavers are solitary by nature, each claiming a vast territory within [[The Shadowfell]].  They are extremely territorial and will fiercely defend their lairs from intruders, including other Dark Weavers.  Their hunting tactics are methodical and ruthless; they prefer to weaken their prey by ambush, relying on the element of surprise and their lethal webs to do most of the work.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/darkling.jpg]]

Be they the children of migrant [[Humans|Human]] seeking refuge in [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] kingdoms, or of [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] merchants who struck rich in the wide open world, the half-dwarves (more commonly known as Darklings) share a mix of traits from both of their parent races. Some say that [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] blood tempers [[Human]] impatience, while others say that [[Human]] heritage allows them to be more flexible than the stone.  The existence of [[Half-Dwarfs|Half-Dwarf]] is as old as their ancestors, though less common. 

!Not Welcome In Either World
There is no taboo against [[Humans|Human]] and [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] breeding, but it is a very rare occurrence; this makes the Darklings misfits and outcasts.  Not feeling a sense of belonging in either community, they are known as [[Sewer Dwarves]] by the [[Human]] civilization, and [[Aalvtaurag]] of &quot;half beards&quot; by the [[Kombar''ran|Dwarf]].

!Their father's nose, their mother's eyes
To [[Humans|Human]], Darklings look like tall [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], and to [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], they look like short [[Humans|Human]]. They typically sit in the middle range of heights between their parents, although they're a little bulkier than the average [[Human]].

!Children Of The Underworld
It is common for Darklings to find work in the criminal underworld, as the race is downtrodden and are alienated by those [[Humans|Human]] and [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] who are more traditionalist in their thinking.  Because of the abject racism they experience, Darklings always expect trouble and know it is safest to protect oneself with armor and weapon when traveling in [[Human]] or [[Dwarvish|Dwarf]] settlements.  Certain situations must be backed up by force, and you will never know when someone will try and take advantage of you.  They have a distinct feeling that everyone else is plotting and scheming in the same way they are.

!Darkling Cunning
Darklings have to be cunning to survive.  They know how to manipulate situations to their advantage, with a mix of [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] greed and [[Human]] adaptability.  Darklings are notoriously tight-fisted, and generally acknowledged to be just as reluctant as [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] to part with their money.  They are tough bargainers and shrewd merchants, and often buy no more than what they need.  The only way to get a Darkling to part with a penny is to offer him a wager, most Darklings enjoy games of chance.  Anyone that is able to out-wit or get the best of a Darkling in a deal will earn his respect and that of other Darklings as well.  Often a Darkling will tell a good story of cunning, even if he himself was out witted.  

!The Gang Is Their Home
Darklings don’t labor or build strongholds of their own.  They consider themselves just a bit more clever than everyone else, allowing other races to toil maintaining civilization while the Darklings reap all of the rewards.  Darklings often form into [[gangs|Darkling Gang]] for safety.  A gang leader is called the [[Cloak|Darkling Cloak]].  Males do not necessarily dominate the [[Darkling Gang]], whoever is the most powerful and most cunning usually leads.  The [[Darkling Cloak]] is ultimately responsible for the actions of his gang, and they operate under his protection.  Gang members always give their [[Darkling Cloak]] a cut of whatever they steal or make.   If anyone ever fails the [[Darkling Cloak]], they are exiled from the [[Darkling Gang]].  The only way to return is to kill a rival of the [[Darkling Cloak]].  Darklings who betray the [[Darkling Cloak]] or rat on a gang member are hunted until they are killed.  The [[Darkling Cloak]] of a Darkling gang is a highly respected individual.  Their orders are carried out indiscriminately, and failure often has due consequences.  Some [[Cloak’s|Darkling Cloak]] are malicious and controlling, treating their [[Darkling Gang]] members as lackey’s or goons.  However most [[Cloaks|Darkling Cloak]] deal with their members as if they were family.  The leadership style of a [[Darkling Cloak]] varies from gang to gang, but all [[Cloak’s|Darkling Cloak]] realize that their power may be challenged at any moment.

All [[gangs|Darkling Gang]] have a distinct name and symbol, which they carry with pride.  Quite often, the most powerful of the [[Darkling Gangs|Darkling Gang]] within a [[Human]] city will operate above ground.  Those that do, often own legitimate businesses to use as a front for their underground operations.  These bold and crafty gangs are well respected among the Darkling community.

<pre>Dathairä (translated as &quot;children of death&quot; in the [[Elvish]] tongue) are supernatural beings that feed on the evil of sentient beings.  They are servants to their creator, [[Azarad-Ji]] - who use the Dathairä to secretly manipulate [[Asha]] to perpetuate chaos, senseless violence and bring about [[Desecration]].  Those skilled in the dark art of [[Blood Magic]] have the power to summon the Dathairä, and petition them for favors.  The Dathairä are known to grant their most loyal servants enormous power - for a price.  Dathairä are known as [[The Corruptors]], [[The Eaters Of Life]], [[The Demiurges]] - [[Uskardeen]] mythology call them the [[Mayombe]], or cannibal spirits.  They vary greatly in power, type and orientation.

While Dathairä serve [[Azarad-Ji]], their master lies locked within a prison of divine making.  In the meantime, the Dathairä are content to manipulate the mortal world in their unrelenting master's absence from the relative safety of their home in [[Baator]].

!Life Beyond Death
Dathairä who perish can find themselves reborn within [[The Kiln Of The Profaned]], located in [[Baator]].  This painful and lengthy process requires a hefty amount of [[Souls|Soul]] to feed the rebirth.  The process is overseen by the [[Duke]] of [[Stygia]].  Failure to have the appropriate funds on hand at this time of need results in the Dathairä's destruction, or devolution to a minor form.

!Known Dathairä
| [img[images/darkones/drelmor-portrait.jpg][Drelmor]] &lt;br&gt;[[Drelmor]] |__[[Drelmor]]__ was the first child of [[Azarad-Ji]].  Strong, fierce and loyal.

!Description
The city of Deepwater is a majestic sight.  The original city of Deepwater was encased within a city wall.  The town then grew too big, and a new city wall was built nearly surrounding the first one.  A new palace and temple were built, grander than the first.  The city streets are wide and clean, and nearly every window has a small window box with a flourishing garden.  Taxation is rather high for the citizens, but in exchange they get peace and prosperity under their gracious and fair [[Emperor]].

In 1025 [[AAP]], agents of [[The Whispered One]] attacked the city; known as [[The Black Night]].  A [[Dracolich]] named [[Gorgothuun]] killed the [[Emperor]] [[Jacob Jedaleon III]], and assisted in the theft of artifacts within [[The Temple Of The Divine]].

They desire the destruction of [[The Gods]] in order to gain ultimate power and control.  Multiple times Desecration was attempted only to be thwarted.

!The First Desecration
[[The First Desecration]] was brought upon by [[Humans]] of [[The First Age]] who used science to tear the dimensional fabric which released [[Azarad-Ji]] and his [[Dathairä]] from their celestial prison.  This nearly caused the extinction of [[Mankind|Human]].  While this belched forth creatures and forces beyond comprehension, full Desecration wasn't achieved due to intervention from [[The Gods]].

The [[Dathairä]] [[Vergadain]] unleashed [[The Primordials|Primordial]] within [[The Fountains Of Creation]] upon [[Asha]]; these giants rained destruction upon the world and distracted [[The Gods]] enough for the armies of [[Azarad-Ji]] to gain an advantage.

Desini Oswin (c. 990 [[AAP]] to Current) was a player character run by [[Erin Disbrow]]

Desini grew up on the outskirts of the city of [[Riverdale]], in the village known as [[Wayfaire]], located in the heart of [[The Dales]].  She was born to [[Oswin Orosco]], a [[Priest]] of [[The Divine Order]] and [[Kalia Orosco]].  At age 16, Desini and her father desperately tried to protect the village from a sudden fire that put everyone at risk.  The fire claimed the life of many, including [[Oswin Orosco]] as well as blinding Desini with the toxic fumes from the apothecary.  Blind and despondent from her father's tragic passing, Desini was left with her mother [[Kalia Orosco]] and younger sister [[Lyla Orosco]].  Desini's blindness made her a burden to her mother, who had to work harder than ever to support the three of them.  One day she met [[Magnus Zizorum]] - a mage as handsome as he was powerful.  His charm got the better of her, and Desini convinced her sister to run away with him.

[[Magnus Zizorum]] had great power to enchant and beguile as well as power over life and death itself.  He gave Desini her vision back, by making a pact with a [[Dathairä]] named [[Draizon]].  This improved her vision greater than it was before - coloring her eyes a purple hue, and granting her the power to cause fear to those she looked upon.  Soon after, [[Magnus Zizorum]] and her sister [[Lyla Orosco]] fell in love and had a baby.  When Desini learned of [[Magnus's|Magnus Zizorum]] plans to sacrifice the child using [[Blood Magic]], Desini plotted a failed attempted to escape with her sister.  During the ritual, Desini stole the baby (who grew to become [[Erik Doorhaus]]) and ran to [[The Grey Companions]] for assistance - who launched a mission to kill [[Magnus Zizorum]].

A decade later, Desini rejoined with [[Erik Doorhaus]] and [[Minerva Carrington]] in the city of [[Brand]] to join [[The Grey Companions]].  She led the exepedition beneath the [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] [[Stronghold]] of [[Kulkar]] and retrieved the evil artifact known as [[The Horn Of Azarad-Ji]].</pre>

<pre>Dew is an [[Uskardeen|Uskard]] narcotic derived from the [[Rujian|Ruje]] process of making the drug known as [[The Wash]].  The creation of Dew is a closely guarded secret.  It is a physical process of draining the [[Magical Essence|Magic]] from [[extra-planar|The Planes Of Existence]] creatures.  Dew is sought after most by the [[Magically Adept|Magic]]; as it is known to enhance and amplify the potential of their [[Magic]].  Dew gives a [[Sorcery]] meta-magic feature to those that ingest it; however it is a dangerous drug.

Dew is refined into a crystal that is crushed and placed most commonly in a hot drink such as tea.  This dissolves the Dew and makes it easier to consume.  The drug has a numbing, acidic taste that brings with it a slight flavor of ammonia.  Slight tingling and numbing sensations are felt when consuming.

!How It Is Made
Dew is made by physically extracting [[Magic]] essence from [[extra-planar|The Planes Of Existence]] creatures.  These can be [[Dathairä]], [[Fey]], [[Celestial]], or [[Shadow]]; each producing a different color of Dew: red, green, blue, and black respectively.  The extraction is painful to the creature, and often deadly.  As it is a physical process and not a [[Blood Magic]] one, the manufacture of the drug does not induce [[Affliction|Afflictions]]; although the process is abhorrent.

Dispater (The Iron Duke, The Father Of Dis) was once a [[Human Soul|Soul]] but now rules over [[The Circle Of Greed|Dis]] in [[Baator]]; one of [[The Lords Of The Nine]].  His mortal life and eventual death is forgotten, even to Dispater - but he remembers clearly wriggling out of the waters of [[The River Lethe]] as one of the first [[Soul Larvae]] to be birthed in [[Baator]].  He clawed and manipulated his way into evolving into a [[Dathairä]] and achieving the rank of [[Archdevil]].  His crowning achievement was the slaying of the [[Archangel]] [[Abalim]] in 7891 [[IO]] by posing as a [[Tortured Soul|Soul]] wishing entry into [[Elysium]].  Returning with [[Abilim's|Abalim]] [[Gauntlets Of Truth|Oton]] gifted to [[Abalim]] by [[Lucian]] herself, Dispater was richly rewarded and promoted to a [[Duke]] - the only [[Mortal Soul]] to achieve the rank.  At this time, [[Baator]] was changing due to the influx of [[Mortal Souls|Soul]] - with new regions and territories forming.  [[Zezebazum]] granted Dispater rule over one of these regions, which Dispater named [[Dis]].  His mission was to harvest [[Souls|Soul]] and mint [[Soul Coins|Soul Coin]].

!Appearance
Dispater appears as a regal, seven-foot tall figure wearing the divine artifact [[Oton]], [[The Gauntlets Of Truth|Oton]] (once worn by the [[Archangel]] [[Abalim]]).  His skin bears dozen of scars and piercings, each of them a past wound that he has turned into a mark of pride.  Unlike other [[Dathairä]], he adorns himself with trappings of a [[Human]]; clothing, jewelry, and even cologne.  Some [[Dathairä]] see this as a sign of weakness, a point that Dispater is quickly able to manipulate to his advantage.

!Master Manipulator
As cunning as he is cruel, Dispater's personality was shaped decisively by the harsh existence of a newborn [[Soul]] in [[Baator]].  He understands intimately the rules of [[Baator]], more deeply than the other [[Dathairä]].  While he views himself as the most civilized of the [[Dukes|Duke]] of [[Baator]], it only means that he kills his prey slowly while extracting as much information from them as he can.  He has been known to show leniency to those who show an equal amount of cunning as himself; amused by the concept of the underdog.</pre>

To be blessed with Divine Favor is to be a conduit of the power of [[The Gods]].  Those so imbued with this power are capable of petitioning [[The Gods]] for miracles, and abilities of great healing.  [[The Gods]] don't grant these powers to anyone who seeks them, only to those who have devoted themselves to a higher calling.

Harnessing this power does not rely on study or training like [[Wizardry]], nor is it an innate talent one is born with like [[Sorcery]].  One learns the ancient rites and prayers and is granted the ability to cast spells based upon an intuitive sense of the deity's wishes.  Those who stray from their devout path could see their powers diminish or be stripped away completely.</pre>

These reptilian monsters have six legs and a sluggish metabolism that only allows a slow movement rate.  It can fly, but only for short periods.  A dracolisk is usually dull in color, with eyes that have a pale glow.

Along with a bite and claw attack, dracolisk posses a gaze that enables them to turn any fleshy creature to stone within 30 feet.  Petrified prey are consumed using a caustic saliva that is able to partially reanimate the flesh enough to chew and digest.

There are many species of Dragon, however they all share a common set of traits.  They are reptilian in nature, consisting of a large serpentine neck, quadrupedal and bat-like leathery wings.  They are warm-blooded magical beings that appear to have some connection with [[Mana]].  Dragons are egg layers, and most specimens have horns, teeth and claws.  They grow rather rapidly as they mature, and books tell of ancient specimens nearly the size of a [[Human]] village.  Dragons possess a natural intelligence and all dragons have the ability to speak.
[[Shadow Dragons|Shadow Dragon]] are Dragons who have been born or spent a large amount of time with plane known as [[The Shadowfell]].

!Dragon Senses
Like many large predatory beasts, dragons have enhanced senses.  They have infravision, granting the ability to see body heat as well as a discriminatory smell that can distinguish familiar scents.  Their abilities make them an apex predator.

!Hibernation
Dragons arequire large periods of hibernation, otherwise their disposition would have made it difficult for sentient life to peacefully thrive in [[Asha]].  Hatchlings sleep on average 15 hours a day (around 66% of their existence) - however as dragons age they begin to enter into cycles of alertness and hibernation.  Younglings modify their behavior to 8 months of activity (with roughly a [[Human]] style sleep schedule of 8 hours a day) followed by 4 months of deep hibernation.  During this time, the youngling often buries itself underground to seek protection.  The need for hibernation grows as dragons age, with ancient dragons being known to hibernate for years or decades.
[[Shadow Dragon]]
!Dragonsight
Ancient Dragon's develop a sense known as [[Dragonsight]].  This grants them the ability to access an ancestral memory.  It is a passive ability that comes and goes in waves; as personalities from long ago surface to provide guidance or knowledge.  This may be what drives their insatiable obsession with collecting hoards and controlling knowledge and puzzles.  

!A Dying Race
It is unknown why the Dragons are a dying race.  Dragon births are rare, with many eggs unable to hatch.  The oldest of the species feel a tug or longing that mysteriously has them fly into the very darkness of space never to return.

!Known Dragons
[[Aglanore]] - an adult red dragon who once lived near [[Uskard]]
[[Culdranth]] - an ancient dragon who was subdued by [[Armondax]]
[[Erseirriog]] The Voiceless - a dragon killed by [[Appius Liberalis]] in 1005 [[AAP]]

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/dragonborn.jpg]]

The Dragonborn arrived on [[Asha]] sometime after [[The Cataclysm]] and during [[The Second Age]].  Dragonborn are taller and heavier than [[Humans|Human]], standing well over 6 ft tall and averaging 250 pounds.  They lived on a secluded island continent known as [[Caldoria]] with their [[Tabaxi]] slaves, cautious of the world beyond the sea.  The [[Dragonborn Elders]] foresaw the coming of [[The Second Desecration]], and sank the civilization to the bottom of the ocean, protected by a magical barrier.  In the year 1021 [[AAP]], the island cities were raised once more to the surface of [[Asha]] in an event known as &quot;[[The Lifting]]&quot;.  While most Dragonborn are found in the floating islands of [[Caldoria]], it is becoming more common for them to be found anywhere in [[Asha]].  There are countless configurations of frills and horns, and some Dragonborn are born without a tail.  Dragonborn come in ten colors: Gold, Silver, Bronze, Copper, Brass, Red, Blue, Green, White, and Black.  Metallic and Chromatic colors live together in harmony - and do not confer personality or temperament.

!The Faith Of The Ten
The first Dragonborn were hatched from magically conditioned [[Dragon]] eggs by the [[Dragon]] progenitors [[Tiamat]] and [[Bahamut]].  The spirits of the Dragonborn, like [[Dragons|Dragon]] are not native to [[Asha]]; and do not abide by the traditional laws of nature or [[The Trials Of Judgement]].  [[The Faith Of The Ten]] is a practice by which the Dragonborn follow to ensure Dragonborn [[Souls|Soul]] pass into the afterlife peacefully.
[[The Festival Of The Moon And Wind]] is a sacred holiday in which all spirits and ancestors are honored, and is the day Dragonborn traditionally choose to marry and join clans.  It is a celebration in which all Dragonborn come together in unity.

!Gender Roles And Family
Female Dragonborn are recognized as being more closely connected to the forces of creation and destruction, and have a higher place in society than the males; especially for mothers.  Dragonborn females lay hard shelled eggs in clutches of 10-20.  The average incubation period is around 80 days, where the parents carefully attend to the clutch.  The children's traits such as gender and color are determined by external environmental factors which the parents carefully control.

!Proud And Strict
The Dragonborn have lived in a strict [[Caste System|Dragonborn Caste]] for [[ages|History]].  This system dictates those Dragonborn with tails (known as [[Draconians]]) are thought to have families of purer blood, and are of higher status than those without (known as [[Ravinites]]).  Non-Dragonborn are called [[The Unseen]], and are of the lowest rank.

!New To Asha
The Dragonborn are still relatively new to [[Asha]], having lived in isolation under the ocean for the most of [[The Fourth Age]].  They remain reclusive, and carefully guard their culture, secrets and wealth from other races.  Many Dragonborn are fierce, and courageously passionate with sharing their thoughts - but respectful of those in power, and believe lineage, age, and gender determine one's position in society.

!The Forged
The Dragonborn have a specialized form of [[Magic]] and Industry that allows the bravest among them to undergo experimentation that melds their flesh with metal in a ritual they call [[The Children Of The Forge]].  This ritual is secretive and permitted to be undertaken only by those Dragonborn who are purest of blood.  [[Blood Magic]], which often [[Corrupts|Corruption]] those native to [[Asha]] does not have the same ill effects on the Dragonborn.  They practice the art of [[Blood Magic]] with no repercussions, with the flora and fauna of [[Caldoria]] being selectively bred by the Dragonborn for centuries in order to fuel their rituals.

!The Scaled Gods
Having been removed from [[Asha]] for so long, it is more common for the Dragonborn to worship [[Tiamat]], [[Bahamut]], and [[Tyrnus]] the [[Dragon]] gods of Chaos, Order, and Balance.  These entities are not [[Elder Gods|The Elder Gods]], but nonetheless possess great power.

!Dragonborn Names
Dragonborn acquire multiple names throughout their lifetime.  Upon hatching, they are given a name of an ancestor out of respect and honor.  When they are old enough to be weened from their parents, the mother chooses a childhood nickname.  Lastly, when the Dragonborn reaches adulthood, they choose their formal name.  Each family also bears a clan name.

__The Children Of The Forge__
While [[The Children Of The Forge]] hold no political office, their power and influence is the greatest within [[Caldoria]].

__Noble Caste -  The //Orders Of Gold, Silver, Copper, Brass, Bronze, Red, Black, White, Green, and Blue //__
The Noble Caste is the highest within [[Dragonborn]] society, believed to have stemmed from a bloodline that is most strongly connected to their [[Dragon]] ancestors.  Each member of the Noble Caste has a tail at birth.  Each color has their own organization known as an Order (e.g. &quot;The Silver Order&quot;).

__The Martial Caste - The Khalivar__
The Martial Caste trains in weapons and fighting.  They earn their rank through soldiering, or as a seasoned [[Gladiator]] in [[The Draconian Fighting Pits]] - which allow a path for those of any race to rise to the prestige level this caste confers.

__The Working Caste - The Dominvian__
[[Dragonborn]] who are skilled artisans, or have practice in [[Magic]] or [[Divine]] talents

__Common Caste - The Ravinites__
[[Dragonborn]] born without tails are not considered pure of blood and take roles of servants and undesirable jobs.  They rank only slightly above [[The Unseen]].

__The Unseen__
[[The Unseen]] are the lowest amongst [[Caldoria]] and include all other [[Non-Dragonborn Races|Races]]

<div title="Dragonborn Elders" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202102202343" modified="202106261131" changecount="6">
<pre>The [[Dragonborn]] Elders are a collection of ten pureblood [[Dragonborn]] who preside over all of [[Caldoria]].  They are respected, honored, and in some cases feared.  It is custom for the elders to preside over matters of significant import to [[Caldoria]].  It was the ten original elders that chose to submerge the continent of [[Caldoria]] beneath the ocean in [[The Second Age]], sealing it from potential [[Desecration]]; and it was a recent council of elders who ignored the signs that the barrier keeping the ocean at bay was failing.

The first elders were chosen out of necessity for leadership and guidance.  They were chosen for both their intelligence and strength.  In those early days, the [[Dragonborn]] were tribal and primitive, separated into 10 factions sorted by their scale color.  Five of the metallic (Gold, Silver, Copper, Brass, Bronze) and five chromatic (Red, Black, White, Green Blue).  These individuals were considered the pinnacle of their race.  As the years progressed, the elders were chosen for their wisdom and leadership.  Each new elder was chosen by the other nine sitting members.

In 1021 [[AAP]], [[Kurga]] The Black, influenced by a [[Dathairä]], murdered the other nine elders and nearly brought [[Desecration]] to [[Caldoria]].  The elders were easy to manipulate, as they naively and brazenly thought themselves immune to the effects of the outside world.

When [[The Grey Companions]] brought [[Caldoria]] to the surface of [[Asha]] once again, it brought change to the [[Dragonborn]] culture.  However, change comes slowly to the [[Dragonborn]] and the institutional structure of the elders stubbornly persists.  Only [[Dragonborn]] purebloods are permitted a seat as an elder.

Draizon is one of [[The Elder Gods]] made up of an enormous mass of tentacles, slime-dripping mouths and lidless eyes.  Small creatures are continually spat forth by the monstrosity, which are either consumed into Draizon's miasmatic form or escape to some monstrous life elsewhere.  Draizon lurks deep in [[The Abyss]] and rarely contacts the mortal realm.  Patient, yet unpredictable; Draizon does not plot and scheme - instead content to only exist, destroying and killing in order to consume, grow and thrive.  

Draizon has no gender, and is described in texts as a &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, and &quot;it&quot;.  However &quot;it&quot; is most appropriate, as Draizon is one of [[The Elder Gods]] - existing before [[The Gods]] and before [[Asha]].  Draizon has power over the flesh, as Draizon itself has never stopped growing and expanding.  

!The Dark Young Of Draizon
The Dark Young Of Draizon, also known as [[Otyugh]] are horrifying, grotesque bulbous creatures with bloated bodies, thick snake like tentacles that end in spikey, leaf-like appendages used to shovel food into its gaping maw.  They plod along on three sturdy legs, but are more content to wait in ambush in mounds of detritus and carrion, leaving only a sensory stalk exposed.  They smell putrid like rotting flesh.

The creatures are usually called upon to preside over cult ceremonies.  One means of summoning them is found in [[The Book Of Mig'dran]] and requires a blood offering.  Cultists have been able to extract what is called [[The Milk Of Draizon]] from these creatures - granting those that drink fierce and dark mutations.

<div title="Draugaira" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202301141935" modified="202303251548" tags="race" changecount="31">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/drow.jpg]]
The Draugaira Elves, or &quot;Children Of The Mist&quot; in the [[Elvish]] language, are a sub-race of [[Elves|Elf]] who have had a troubled history since [[The Third Age]].  Their culture was centered in the continent of what is modern day [[Amon]], and they peacefully coexisted with the growing [[Human]] civilizations.  Late in the age, a [[Human]] warlord named [[Ammenon]] began killing the Draugaira by the thousands as fuel for a dark ritual to achieve immortality.  Nearly wiped to extinction, modern day Draugaira remain wary of the hubris of [[Humans|Human]].  They are efficient and frugal with the use of their energy and resources, having learned to conserve them for the possibility of future conflict or harm that is unseen and unprovoked.

!Appearance
The Draugaira resemble other [[Elves|Elf]], with wiry and athletic bodies, and chiseled features.  Skin tones cover a spectrum of grey to black.  Similarly, Draugaira eyes are generally a shade of pale blue, silver or violet.  Their hair is shock white or platinum.

!Skilled At Magic
The majority of the Draugaira are familiar with and own [[Enchanted|Enchantment]] clothing and items, as their culture is adept in both [[Sorcery]] and [[Wizardry]], and is credited with the discovery of [[Eldermancy]] and a secretive art known as [[Umbramancy]].

!Haunted By The Memory Of Near Extinction
The Draugaira are a cautious and vigilant race, haunted by the memory of their near-extinction at the hands of the [[Human]], [[Ammenon]].  Having survived this dark period in their history, they maintain a watchful eye over [[Human]] growth and progress, ever aware of the potential threats that may arise from unchecked [[Human]] expansion.  Though they keep their distance from [[Humans|Human]], they are cautious; distrust runs deep and is rooted in conflict and betrayal.  Many can name countless atrocities committed against them by [[Humans|Human]].  They remember the burning of their forests, the poisoning of their rivers, and the enslavement of their people.

To the Draugaira, [[Humans|Human]] are reckless, arrogant, and dangerous.  A species that cannot be trusted to act with wisdom or restraint.  This resentment colors their interactions with [[Humans|Human]], leading many [[Elves|Elf]] to avoid them altogether or to treat them with open hostility.  Despite this, there are some among the Draugaira who cling to hope for a better future, who believe that [[Humans|Human]] and [[Elves|Elf]] can find a way to coexist peacefully.  But for many, the grudge remains; a bitter reminder of the past and a warning of what may yet come to pass.

!The Reliquary
[[Reliquary]] is the name given to the [[Enchanted|Enchantment]] artifacts that have the ability to capture souls of dying [[Elves|Elf]].  It is one of the most treasured possessions of the Draugaira.  When an [[Elf]] dies near a [[Reliquary]], their soul is drawn within where it is stored until the time comes for reincarnation.  The Draugaira carefully guard and protect this artifact, and it serves as the central heart of their cities.  To the Draugaira, the [[Reliquary]] is not just a means of preserving their numbers, but a symbol of their unity and resilience in the face of adversity.  They hold it in the highest reverence, and its maintenance is seen as a sacred duty.
There is a deep spiritual significance to the [[Reliquary]].  The souls of their ancestors reside within it, and the artifact itself is imbued with a sacred energy that connects them to their past and future.  It is a source of comfort and hope for the Draugaira.

!Resistance At What Cost?
The Draugaira of [[The Third Age]] were split on how to defend against the war with [[Ammenon]].  While many wished to fight with traditional means, there were some who thought to combat [[Ammenon's|Ammenon]] [[Blood Magic]] with [[Blood Magic]] of their own.  Willing to sacrifice anything in order to protect their families and way of life, these Draugaira gave everything for victory, becoming what they most despised.  Mutating their bodies, that transformed into monstrous creatures that were half [[Elf]] and half Spider, known as [[Driders|Drider]].  Their transformation was in vain, for it corrupted their mind and drove them insane.

!The Unfinished Mission of The Draugaira Elves
Before leaving behind [[The Divine Gate]], [[Lucian]] entrusted the Draugaira with a sacred task: to spread the word of [[The Gos]] to the [[Humans|Human]] who dwelt in the lands beyond their own.  Alas, their hopes were dashed by the cruel and senseless actions of a single [[Human]]: [[Ammenon]].  By this warlord slaughtering them and shattering their once-great civilization, the words of the gods that they had been entrusted to carry were left unsaid.

The Draugaira are a deeply religious people, and their faith is central to their way of life.  This religion, known as [[The Sovereign Host]] is a complex and nuanced belief that [[The Elysians|Elysian]] (known as Sovereigns) can be seen and felt in all things; even in their absence.  For the Draugaira, their religion is more than just a set of beliefs and practices; it is a way of life. They see themselves as servants of the gods, and they strive to live their lives in accordance with the divine will. They are guided by a strict code of ethics and morality, and they seek to do good in the world wherever they can.

<pre>The Draugr are the [[Undead]] ancestors of the [[Duergar'Ran]] [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] cursed to rise again by [[The Whispered One]] in [[The Third Age]].  They tirelessly work without knowing rest, only fragments of their former selves.  In this state they become shambling shadows of their former selves, drones that are capable of understanding simple instructions.  Only occasionally does the personality of the former [[Duergar'Ran]] surface.

!Revered By The Family
In [[Duergar'Ran]] society, it is tradition to care for former family members that have become Draugr.  As time goes on, many families consist of more Draugr than they do living relatives.  This makes it challenging to watch over them, making it a communal duty.  At times, Draugr need to be locked away or secured for their own safety (and that of the community), however this is done with shame.  The Draugr are not evil or malicious, and are often compliant to requests and orders.  However they will aggressively protect their family and homeland.

While a Draugr's existence is long lasting, it is not permanent.  With time, their bodies begin to decay (albeit at a slow pace) and they fall apart.  It is the family's obligation to make this process as easy and comfortable for the Draugr.

!Description
Dravar is most known for its beaches made of small shells instead of sand.  The local [[Quori]] closely guard the secret for crushing the shells into [[Dravarian Silver Sand]] which they can smelt and weave into either flexible or rigid glass.  It is the richest city of [[The Hegemony]] and their architecture, culture, and people are known for their extravagance and wealth.  The native [[Quori]] live in harmony with the people of the city, despite not living directly inside of it.

The money that flows through Dravar makes it one of the most corrupt city one could ever dream of, famed for its beauty of its people and architecture as well.  It is a center for culture and the arts.  The organization known as [[The Five Rings]] is stationed here, a powerfully rich cabal of merchant princes that control trade and commerce within the city.  [[The Five Rings]] is known to be tough, but fair.

He was beautiful and just, but known to be rash.  Of all of the [[Kiraga]], the most is known about him.  Before his fall, he was known as [[Nethitine Elanathi]] ([[Elvish]] translation Sunshine Starry Host) prince of [[The Bloodline Of Elanathi]].  He and his twin brother [[Una'Unti Elanathi]] ([[Elvish]] translation One Pine) were in line for the throne.  When their father [[Megli Elenathi]] ([[Elvish]] translation &quot;bear&quot;) lay unresponsive due to a deep [[Longing Of Kalara]].  

[[Zezebazum]] entered the court in the guise of healer to tend to the king.  He spun lies to [[Nethitine Elanathi]], making him believe his twin brother was wicked and cruel.  [[Zezebazum]] wrongly convinced him that his father was not [[Longing Of Kalara]], but instead poisoned by [[Una'Unti Elanathi]] in an attempt to seize the throne for himself.  Changing form into the twin brother, [[Zezebazum]] poisoned [[Nethitine Elanathi]] during the impending struggle.  Poisoned, bloody and dying, [[Nethitine Elanathi]] was enraged.  Yet again in the form of the healer, [[Zezebazum]] comforted [[Nethitine Elanathi]], and informed him that the poison was ancient and evil.  He claimed that drinking his rival's blood would be an antidote, however there would be grave consequences.  Healed enough to stand up and seek revenge, [[Nethitine Elanathi]] ignored [[Zezebazum]] and his warnings, responding that he would deal with the consequences once his brother lay dead.

Drinking the blood of his brother sealed him to [[Azarad-Ji]], and turned him into the [[Kiraga]] he is today.  Now he is known as [[Dego]], and is cursed to stalk the night and seek blood for survival.</pre>

!Description
Drellin's Ferry is one of the few safe passages across [[The Nenakessana River]].  The spot was known to the [[Kell]] as Drellinsild (or Dwarfbridge in [[The Old Tongue]]), as the river was once spanned by a sturdy [[Dwarf]]-made bridge at this spot, as a means to connect and trade with [[The Sylvan Empire]] in the previous [[Age|The Third Age]].  Prior to [[The Amoni Invasion]] the bridge washed out in a great flood.  A few hundred years ago, an enterprising man named [[Dayson]] hammered together a small horse-drawn ferry to maintain a river crossing here, and a town eventually grew up around the enterprise.

!Social Customs
*On 1/25 the town celebrates [[Evermeet]], a day honoring love and unity.
*The town holds a festival on 3/25 celebrating the final harvest.  There is music, dancing, and a large pig is roasted in an open pit.

The Drengi (translated to &quot;Slayer&quot; in [[Dwarvish]]) are rare and thought to the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] to be stories of myth and legend.  They stand on four of its six legs, towering up to 7 feet in height.  The other two legs, armed with wicked spikes, are used to seize and hold prey.  The Drengi lashes out with both forelegs, grabbing its victim.  Treat this as an attack at 1-hex reach that grapples if the victim loses the Contest of [[Dexterity]].  Once having grapples its victim, the Drengi begins to feast, generally biting its prey on the neck first to kill it.  The forelegs do crushing damage on the turn it grapples.  Breaking free from the grapple requires either a successful Contest of Strength or doing enough damage to cripple the limbs.  The Drengi will usually bite only after having grappled its prey.

The Drengi come in a variety of colors: white, black, grey, red and purple.  This color appears to signify some rank or meaning to their hierarchy within their hive.  They do possess a form of raw intelligence, but one that has no respect for the life of other creatures.  They are pure evil, living in nests under the command of a single powerful queen.  The Drengi are parasitic, implanting eggs within living hosts.  Hatchling Drengi consume the host, taking on some of the host's characteristics.  When a Drengi hatches from a host capable of [[Magic]], they also possess the means to cast spells.</pre>

}}}
There is a connection to all natural things, and Druids dedicate their lives to understand and preserve this connection. There are those who are
born with a [[Soul]] that can feel the calling of [[the primal forces of nature|Primal Magic]]. They gain their power from the spirit inherit in the cosmos and are embodiments of nature’s resilience, cunning, and fury.
!The Old Faith
Druids revere nature and the natural order above all. They pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than a devotion to a divine
entity or religious construct. These ancient traditions are woven into the fabric of life itself, and referred to as [[The Old Faith]].  In contrast to the worship of [[gods|The Gods]] in temples and shrines, [[The Old Faith]] is not written in tomes and texts, but felt within the wind and seen in the stars.  [[The Old Faith]] believes that plants and animals all share a [[Soul]] that originates from [[Valouria]] herself, known simply as [[The Mother|Valouria]]. Druids do not worship her per se, but seek to preserve her gift of life. As all life on [[Asha]] sprang forth from her tomb, all life must also return in [[The Eternal Cycle]].  Druids attune to this spiritual energy.
!Preservers Of Balance
Nature exists in a precarious balance. The seven forces that make up nature - Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Dusk, Dawn, and Stars - must remain in equilibrium. If one natural force were to gain power over the others, the universe could collapse. Thus, Druids oppose those who promote one force to the exclusion of others. Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature rather than opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations and
undead. They believe that life and death are blessings from [[The Mother|Valouria]], and despise those who attempt to thwart that balance.
!Spirit Of Valouria
Becoming a Druid is to be visited by [[a nature spirit|Faeratha]] that guides them towards a dying beast.  They attend to this creature in its final moments, and accept its [[Soul]] as part of their own. Taking this spirit changes their personality and character to match the animal’s. The Druid is assured a
friendly, or at least neutral reaction from the spirit’s species.  This spirit is placed into the Druid’s care like a seed, and they must nurture and grow it over
time. Acceptance of this spirit is a commitment to uphold the tenets and strictures of nature.  Eventually this seed consumes the Druid and they return to
nature in a selfless embodiment of beauty, and an act of love and life in glory of [[The Mother|Valouria]].
!Leylines
[[The Old Faith]] has its traditions and places of pilgrimage, places of power and majestic beauty based in the natural world that hold great significance. To the casual observer, there is nothing special to mark these locations, but they are instantly recognizable to a Druid. While all of [[Asha]] is sacred to Druids, these places emanate mystical power and act as portals to other [[Planes Of Existence|The Planes Of Existence]]. Druids guard these locations with fervor, to ensure balance is maintained</pre>

<div title="Duergar'Ran" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202307082018" modified="202307301720" tags="race" changecount="20">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/duergar.jpg]]
|![[Click Here For Information on the Dwarvish Language|Dwarvish]]|

The Duergar'Ran (&quot;the clan of the people who make in the [[Dwarvish]] language) are a race of [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], who can be found on the continents of [[Ruje]] and [[Amon]].  They were once [[Kombar'Ran]] [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] who were cursed by [[The Whispered One]] in [[The Third Age]] using [[Blood Magic]].  This causes the Duergar'Ran to rise again when they die into a mindless [[Draugr]] that only retains a small semblance of their previous personality.

!Appearance
The curse they were imbued with in [[The Third Age]] causes them to have white hair and ashen grey skin; remnants of the [[Blood Magic]] performed on their ancestors.  Their descendants carry these traits naturally from birth.  Like their [[Kombar'Ran]] cousins, they are typically thick, stocky figures with the men growing long white beards.

!History
The Duergar'Ran were once renown for their beautiful and ingenious craftsmanship.  An architecture that was described as lighter and freer than that of their [[Kombar'Ran]] cousins.  This changed in [[The Third Age]] when they were enslaved and forever cursed by [[The Whispered One]].

At their heart, their troubled past and existing cuse makes them a grim and bitter race, pessimistic of their future and deeply cynical regarding the motives of others.  [[The Whispered One]], a [[Lich]] of [[The Third Age]] enslaved the Duergar'Ran and used them to build the foundations of a great civilization known as [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]].  During the centuries that followed, the Duergar'Ran toiled in bondage; stripped of much of their cultural identity as they were subjected to vile treatment.  Gone was the beauty and grace of their work, and in its place a utilitarian style; their ideal of achieving mastery of a craft meaning nothing to them now.

Duergar'Ran creations aren't flawed or subpar, and in fact are built to be enduring, but have become completely utilitarian, considered valuable only for their function and bereft of warmth and artistry.  Appreciation of beauty had been erased from their minds, the aesthetics of their creation ignored.  Their works were not labors of love, for their goal was no longer artistry.

!Cultural Identity
The modern Duergar'Ran feel less connection to [[Kombar]] and are not practitioners of [[The Undermountain Papacy]].  Family bonds are culturally significant, with families caring for their ancestor [[Draugr]] with reverence.  Traditionally guarded and suspicious of outsiders, Duergar'Ran are cunning and taciturn, but can be just as kind-hearted, loyal and compassionate as their [[Kombar'Ran]] cousins; especially to those they think of as family.  The [[Draugr]] fill Duergar'Ran society with tireless and endless work, as they do not know the meaning of rest.

!The Draugr
The [[Draugr]] are the [[Undead]] ancestors of the Duergar'Ran and are revered by all of the Duergar'Ran.  When a Duergar'Ran dies, the curse that was placed upon them causes them to not [[Return To The Stone]], but instead rise as an [[Undead]] [[Draugr]].  In this state they become shambling shadows of their former selves, capable of understanding simple instructions and words enough to get glimpses of the former Duergar'Ran that they once were.  While only fragments of their former selves, it is tradition for the living descendants to care for the [[Draugr]]; a difficult task when they work without rest.

<pre>Duncan Littletoes (937 [[AAP]] - 990 [[AAP]])) was a [[Bairn]] of renown within [[The Stone Lands]] of [[Kellos]].  He is legendary for his singing and songwritting, known to many simply as Littletoes.  He is regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of [[The Stone Lands]], and served as the court musician to [[House Anwyn]] for 30 years from 960 [[AAP]] to 990 [[AAP]].  His energized interpretations of songs were appropriated from [[Orcish|Orc]] music and were a hit among the aristocracy.  This even granted him a performance in front of [[Emperor]] [[Jayce Jedaleon II]], where he received much favor.  His most famous tune was &quot;[[Without His Arms]]&quot; (written in 962 [[AAP]]) - while the lyrics were written by him, the melody and rhythm was lifted directly from an [[Orcish|Orc]] war chant.

In his later years, he became equally renowned for his appetite for food, drink and merriment.  Duncan was rumored to enjoy gravy on everything regardless of if it required it or not.  He became a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self.  Hugely overweight, he passed away from heart failure.  Many were distraught by his passing, and true Littletoes fans actually believe his passing was a rumor that Duncan cooked up in order to escape the limelight and live a normal life in solitude.  Sightings of him occur despite him having a prominent tomb in the city of [[Skoras]].  Die hard fans claim the tomb is empty, and sightings of him still cause a stir.

Prior to his death, Duncan gifted the lyre he used to perform in front of [[Emperor]] [[Jayce Jedaleon II]] to [[Santino Jamarion]], a former student and apprentice.

Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder.  They delight in labor, and take great pride in their crafts.  They mine the earth and build their homes within. Dwarves are respected craftsman and trade their goods with all the noble races of Asha.  The quality of their goods is unmatched and this usually makes them expensive.  They are also shrewd businessmen and tough bargainers.  

!Children Of Kombar
The Dwarves are a creation of [[Kombar]], set upon [[Asha]] to care for the resting place of [[Valouria]].  Their loyalty to [[Kombar]] is unwavering, and their society is built upon the [[Mordmarr'Khan]] or &quot;The Undermountain Papacy&quot;.  The Dwarves happily toil at their caretaking of the stone of [[Asha]], while simultaneously preparing to defend it from evil for the glory of [[Kombar]].  While the Dwarves are often greedy and miserly, they have strict morals of justice passed down from their elders.  Rarely will a Dwarf resort to theft or swindling.  However, they have no problem forcing other underground races from their homes in order to expand their territory or gain better mines.  After all, they are the rightful owners of [[The Underdark]].

| [img[images/races/dwarf-portrait.jpg][Kombar'Ran]]  |__[[Kombar'Ran]]__ or (&quot;the clan of god&quot; in the [[Dwarvish]] language) share a culture that is pragmatic and traditionalist.  They are fiercely self-sufficient and dedicate their lives to the service of [[Kombar]].  While most [[Kombar'Ran]] live within [[Strongholds]] deep beneath [[Asha]], there are some who venture forth to live integrated into [[Human]] society. |

Their curse gives them grey skin and white hair, remnants of the blood ritual used to curse them.  The [[Duergar'Ran]] are only found within [[Ruje]] and parts of [[Amon]].  Upon death, they become a shadow of themselves; unable to speak but still retaining a fragment of their former selves.  They are revered and cared for and nurtured by the living. |</pre>

<div title="Dweomer Cat" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202303121432" modified="202401201437" tags="creature beast" changecount="12">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/bestiary/dreamlands-cat.jpg]]

Dweomer Cats are supernaturally intelligent beasts able to cross the boundaries between [[The Material Plane]] and [[Sene'Rine'Rada]] with surprising ease.  They are nearly indistinguishable from a normal cat, other than a white mark upon their chest and markings common on their back.

!Magic Item Melding
If a Dweomer Cat carries a tiny magic item into [[Sene'Rine'Rada]], they can choose to meld it permanently into their body.  If it requires atonement, it must be attuned in order to meld with it.  When melded, it permanently vanishes and becomes a part of the cat's body, manifesting as a marking on their back of their fur.  Likewise, the item can be chosen to be removed while traveling to [[the dream world|Sene'Rine'Rada]].  A melded item's magic aura can still be detected normally.

!Moon Jump
It is easy for the Dweomer Cat to physically travel between [[Sene'Rine'Rada]] and [[The Material Plane]].  They can sense the hidden gates that are shifting and moving locations over time, often only opening for a few seconds at a time.  They may travel through one of these gates if they are nearby a creature who is sleeping.

!Limb Allocation
Unlike a terrestrial cat, Dweomer Cats have the ability to absorb or extrude its legs once a day.  It must concentrate for10 minutes to adjust the number of legs it has, as if concentrating on a spell.  Each additional leg grants them increased speed and agility, for a small price.

!Nine Lives
When killed, a Dweomer Cat's mind and consciousness shifts reflexively back into a dream form, creating a new dream body if necessary.  It must then rest for 1d3 days in [[Sene'Rine'Rada]] at which point it can return to the waking world.</pre>

Eiddoel Earthhammer III (912 [[AAP]] - Current) is the current [[Dorn]] of [[Kulkar]] and head of [[Clan Earthhammer]].  Son of [[Eiddoel Earthhammer II]], brother of [[Dargay Earthhammer]].  As a young boy, he admired his elder brother [[Dargay Earthhammer]] for his leadership and skill with words.  Over time, their father began to show signs of age and began to squander the city's fortune through bad business dealings and was soon a mockery among merchants and neighboring trade cities.  The citizens of [[Kulkar]] began to speak the end of Earthhammer rule of the city; which had existed since its founding.  [[Dargay Earthhammer]], the eldest son, challenged his father to step down in 932 [[AAP]] resulting in an angry exchange where [[Dargay Earthhammer]] was exiled from [[Kulkar]].  Eiddoel III was only 20 years old, young for a [[Dwarf]] and now the only one to hold his father in check.

Eiddoel III's father began a steady mental and physical decline.  Along with being mocked by those who dealt with him, he struggled to even perform basic tasks like feeding and dressing himself.  Eiddoel III stood by his father, tending to his every need in place of servants.  He sought to hide the embarrassment of a [[Dorn]] who could not tend to himself and protect the Earthhammer legacy.  All of this time, he put up with his father's confusion, delusion, disorientation, forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, and inability to create new memories.  His father was belligerent, and showed his son no gratitude or pride; except for one instance where in a foggy stupor confused Eiddoel for his brother [[Dargay Earthhammer]] and was so thankful for his return and apologized for his mistake of exile.  

Eiddoel III's jealousy that he harbored for his brother [[Dargay Earthhammer]] grew to exponential bounds during this time.  His brother was out experiencing [[Asha]], pretending to be a hero; while he was stuck tending to an old fool.

In 943 [[AAP]], [[Eiddoel Earthhammer II]] passed away and [[returned to the stone|Return To The Stone]]; many called it a mercy.  For many of the years prior, Eiodel III was the de facto reagent due to his father's mental state; it was natural for him to assume the throne despite it being his brother's by rite.  The [[Kestaz]] at the time, [[Vardrada Orebender]] while privately administering funeral rites for the late king made it clear to Eiddoel that she disapproved of him assuming the throne.   She felt his young age was enough to contest; and would end the Earthhammer reign.  Eiddoel was the only one present over his father's body when she made this claim.  She then was found at the bottom of the cylindrical shaft, apparently having committed suicide by falling 38 floors; her body was unrecognizable but her clothing was clearly distinguishable.  The next day, Eiddoel Earthhammer III was crowned [[Dorn]] of [[Kulkar]]..

He is cunning, proud and shrewd.  He is self important, and surrounds himself with opulence and signs of wealth.  The [[Earthhammer Clan]] is a ancient one, and the original founders of [[Kulkar]] - and [[Eiddoel Earthhammer III]] demands the respect his office and lineage deserves.  Rumors abound that it was him who killed his father and the previous [[Kestaz]], but they are spoken only as whispers else they reach his ears and bring his wrath - which is unbounded.</pre>

The Eldarin are a race of [[Fey]], members of [[The Fair Folk]], who are fountains of perilous beauty and boundless magic.  Each Eldarin resonates with emotions captured in [[The Feywild]] in the form of seasons - affinities that affect the Eldarin's mood and appearance.  An Eldarin's season can change, although some remain in one season forever.

!Appearance
The Eldarin resemble [[Elves|Elf]] in a fashion: tall, slender, and graceful.  However there were some notable differences, such as their ears tending to be exceptionally longer and their hair and skin able to take on metallic hues which would change with their moods.  The Eldarin have the ability to change their appearance to have an affinity with a season; how frequently they changes this appearance was an individual choice.  Some Eldarin spend their entire lives in the same season or followed the seasons of the place where they lived, while others will change each day.

Eldergrass is a species of water plant that grows exclusively on the shores of [[Lake Mistmoor]].  There are actually over 30 species of Eldergrass along the lake, feeding off of the trace amounts of [[Cavorite]] in the water and converting it into [[Residuum]] through a process not unlike photosynthesis.  This process is most active when the mists of [[The Lake|Lake Mistmoor]] are thickest; causing the Eldergrass to emit a faint hum and glow.  The various species have unique colors and sounds, causing the locals to also name this plant &quot;Choir Reed&quot;, or &quot;Fairy Weed&quot;.

!Alchemy and Crafting
The stems and leaves of the plant can be used to make paper, and is especially effective in making spellbooks.  While the plant creates paper with a strong texture and is hard to bleach, it makes up for it with being water resistant.</pre>

ElethaNori &quot;Mother's Gift&quot; in [[Elvish]] (c. 18th of [[Ches]] 206 [[AAP]] to Current) was a player character run by [[Elizabeth Disbrow]].  She is the [[Apotheon]] of PEACE, FATE, and LIFE and is the creator of the [[Korok]] of [[Arborea]].  She was born a [[Variona'Sha]] [[Elf]] in the [[Forana'loloKashira]] [[Haven|Havens]] of [[Numeneithela]].  She is the daughter of [[CsaraAsha]] (&quot;To Yearn For Home&quot;) and a [[Shaman]] of [[The Stag Clan]], [[NeneHwesta]] (&quot;Moon Shadow&quot;).  Her mother [[CsaraAsha]] died tragically in childbirth in an event that left her father blind.

!Daughter Of The Druid
As she grew, ElethaNori found her father [[NeneHwesta]] to be very loving and devoted but at times distant and lost in his own thoughts.  The [[Elves|Elf]] of [[Numeneithela]] loved and respected her father, who was the oldest and wisest [[Shaman]] of the [[Variona'Sha Clans]].  Some would remark that the other [[clans|Variona'Sha Clans]] have seen their [[Shaman]] pass on the mantle (some multiple times), and even the new clan of [[The Snake|The Snake Clan]] arose within his lifetime.  It was clear to ElethaNori that this fact pained [[her father|NeneHwesta]] most of all, who was confused and bewildered as to why [[The Mother|Valouria]] had not sent a replacement for him.  The more he dwelt upon this line of thinking, the longer he would disappear for stretches of time on a sojourn.  Before leaving he would state to ElethaNori that we has leaving to &quot;Still his mind and heed the whispers of [[Valouria]]&quot;; [[Lucian's|Lucian]] last words.

!The Awkward Elf
Growing up the daughter of the [[Shaman]] of the [[The Stag Clan]] had its privileges.  ElethaNori lived among the [[Forana'loloKashira]], venerated as a protector and warrior [[Variona'Sha]].  ElethaNori found herself drawn to [[Forana'loloKashira]] culture more than that of [[The Stag Clan]].  Despite this, she had nothing but love for [[The Stag Clan]] and had many friends there - she simply did not feel the calling that they all shared.  She searched hard to find her place in the order of things. She spent years apprenticed to the hunter [[Venhu'Driane]] (&quot;Oak Breeze&quot;) trying to be a warrior/protector only to find she lacked any knack with martial weapons.  She spent nearly a decade as an apprentice to the craftsman [[Arro'Feti]] (&quot;The Music Above&quot;) only to find crafting unfulfilling.  In similar fashion, she moved from one labor and task to another without success.  Her closest friends continued to ask if she had seen a [[Faeratha]], the spiritual calling of a [[Druid]].  ElethaNori wanted dearly to be a [[Druid]] like her father, and would pray to [[The Mother|Valouria]] for her to send a spirit - but she never listened.

!Learning Patience
It was [[Cala]] (&quot;Day&quot;), one of the elders of the [[Haven|Havens]], who taught ElethaNori patience.  [[Cala]] was close with ElethaNori's mother [[CsaraAsha]] and [[Cala]] took on the mantle of a motherly figure for ElethaNori.  [[Cala]] taught ElethaNori the art of tea known as [[Lysathira]], gifting her late mother's tea set to her.  The ceremony surrounding [[Lysathira]] came naturally to ElethaNori, for the first time she felt connected to something and could begin to relax and let go.

!Finding Her Spirit
[[Cala]] passed into [[The Fields Of Kalara]] in 1026 [[AAP]].  While there were years to prepare for the event, her passing greatly effected ElethaNori.  While ever fiber of her being knew that [[Cala]] was comforted in the embrace of [[The Mother|Valouria]], she was overcome with a deep sadness and loss.  In a moment of weakness, she found a quiet place to cry.  The weight of losing her anchor and having an unclear future when everyone around her seemed so certain about their place in [[The Eternal Cycle]] was wearing on her.  She was filled with surprise when she felt the cool breeze and heard the distinct sound of wooden chimes - seeing a [[Faeratha]] for the first time.  Such a rare sighting was clearly a sign from [[The Mother|Valouria]].  ElethaNori was touched with the sighting, thankful for [[The Mother's|Valouria]] generocity.  She was surprised when it acknowledged her and waddled over.  A small fury creature with antlers and a wooden mask that seemed almost sad.  It raised up a hand holding a small dandelion, offering it to ElethaNori.  Taking the flower, the creature scrambled up the log she was sitting on to sit beside her.  After a moment it cuddled up to her with a hug.
The spirit grew more excited with time, and clearly wanted ElethaNori to follow.  She packed a small bag and left, feeling badly that she couldn’t share the news with her [[Cala]].  The spirit took her out of her comfort zone, leaving [[The Elvish Lands]] for the first time.

!New Friends
Three new friends joined ElethaNori on her quest.  [[Aereon Zara Al-Wali]] was a [[Human Soul|Soul]] turning to darkness and in desperate need of [[The Mother's|Valouria]] guidance and love.  ElethaNori was bonded to her through friendship, intrigued by [[Aereon's|Aereon Zara Al-Wali]] unwavering curiosity and lack of patience.  [[Wyanne Loom]] the [[Human]] [[Bard]] and [[Staz Amrius Kafanz]] the [[Orc]] [[Paladin]] soon joined them.  ElethaNori marveled at these individuals that [[The Mother|Valouria]] had united through an unlikely friendship.  They named their adventuring party [[The Travelers]].

!The Butterfly Clan
The [[Faeratha]] led ElethaNori to her spirit animal, [[The Butterfly|The Butterfly Clan]].  Upon seeing it, she was filled with love and caring for this [[Soul]] that she was to nurture for the remainder of her life.  The butterfly symbolized peace, grace, growth, rebirth, playfulness, and profound spiritual transformation.  ElethaNori was overwhelmed with the idea of forming a new clan, always assuming she would replace her father as [[Shaman]] of [[The Stag Clan]].

!The Banshee
ElethaNori encountered a [[Banshee]] named [[Minuka]].  Recognizing the pain and anguish, ElethaNori comforted her and helped her pass beyond [[The Material Plane]] to [[The Fields Of Kalara]].  ElethaNori learned that pain can be an anchor that holds one to a dangerous path, and change is necessary to free ones [[Soul]] from torment.  It is true that &quot;Every Day We Are Born Again&quot;.

!The Apotheon
When she raised to the position of an [[Apotheon]], she witnessed the desolation of one of [[The Planes Of Existence]] known as [[Limbo]].  It is said that she shed a single tear and blessed the realm with life, planting a [[Heartree]] that enveloped the [[Plane|Arborea]].  During this act of love and creation, a [[Race]] of creatures known as [[Korok]] were born.  Divine messengers of [[ElethaNori's|ElethaNori]] purpose, they cleanse and prepare [[the universe|The Planes Of Existence]] for the eventual end of [[The Eternal Cycle]].</pre>

While they share much in common, there are multiple types of Elves.  They are most identifiable by their unique culture, practices and beliefs.

!A Timeless Perspective
While Elves do not age, older Elves are known to suffer from what is known as the [[Longing Of Kalara]], a deep yearning to return to [[The Fields Of Kalara]] an be reunited with those they have lost, as well as their goddess [[Lucian]].  Being immortal provides a broad perspective on events that might trouble shorter-lived [[Races]].  They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy.  They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance.  When pursuing a goal however, they are relentless.

!Innate Sorcery
All Elves are born with an innate [[Sorcery]].  This manifests as a set of cantrips at their disposal.  Birth of an [[Elf]] baby is a rare event, and even more rare are the [[Achasiono]] (translated as &quot;unnatural&quot;).  This is the name given to an [[Elf]] born without the natural ability of [[Sorcery]].  Usually, these children are a bit odd and are cast out of their [[Havens]] by the [[The Emerald Order]] out of fear of their unusual traits.  Therefore, many [[Achasiono]] lack the basic racial traits that are integral to the wood elf.

!Fey Ancestry
All Elves have an otherworldly connection to the [[Fey]].  This grants them a connection to their creator, [[Lucian]], as well as a magical resistance to [[Glamour]].  Due to their connection to the [[Fey]], elves don't need to sleep.  Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hour a day.  While they meditate, they dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.  After resting this way, they gain the same befits that a [[Human]] does from 8 hour of sleep.

| [&gt;img[images/races/forana-lolo-kashira-preview.jpg][Forana'loloKashira]] |__[[Forana'loloKashira]]__ are Elves that live deep in Forest [[Havens]].  After the fall of [[The Sylvan Empire]], they gave up life within their cities - seeing their exploration of [[Magic]], Art and Science as inherently dangerous.  They strive to be a passive force on the planet of [[Asha]], to avoid the possibility of contributing to another [[Desecration]]. |
| [&gt;img[images/races/variona-sha-preview.jpg][Variona'Sha]] |__[[Variona'Sha]]__ are nomadic Elves that live in the eastern plains of [[Kellos]].  They are considered savage and fierce warriors.  Their hatred for the [[Orc]] and [[Troll]] races are fanatic - and they hunt and kill them in ruthless abandon.  The [[Variona'Sha]] coexist with the other races, and are often the face of the Elves - as the [[Forana'loloKashira]] are reclusive and indifferent to the events of [[Asha]] |
| [&gt;img[images/races/drow-portrait.jpg][Draugaira]] |__[[Draugaira]]__ are Elves native to the continent of [[Amon]] who were hunted to near extinction near the end of [[The Third Age]].  Those few that persist have grown cruel and militant at being driven from their rightful place on [[Asha]], and see the [[Human]] race as a bitter rival.  Once beautiful surface dwellers like their brethren, they forsook the light and found safety in the dark but dangerous recesses of [[Asha]] - changing their race forever. |</pre>

Eliander Volkos (964 [[AAP]] - current) is a [[Patriar]] in the city of [[Heliopolis]] within the continent of [[Amon]].  He is a lean and imposing figure, who appears younger than his year, with only small patches of grey within his hair to signal his 60+ years.

He is one of the richest [[Patriar]] of [[Heliopolis]], in [[The Polité Of Cobalt]] and is considered a man of great learning.  He is haughty, blunt, and domineering.  Methodical, and ambitious.  He possesses a calm demeanor in most situations, though the smile he offers could be full of secret meanings to those observant enough to catch them.  He has a powerful gift of oratory, able to curry great favor with the common people.

Eliander was a man of low birth, and rose to power in 985 [[AAP]] when working as a dock master in [[Heliopolis]] he manipulated a fight between members of the trade guilds.  He immediately began using his burgeoning cunning and influence to unite and consolidate the fragmented factions of the [[Heliopolis]] underworld; and assumed leadership of a united criminal organization three years later with a bloody takeover.  All crime within the city occurs under the watch of his organization, which he carefully manipulates from a distance in order to keep his reputation clean.  He uses his criminal connections like a musician uses an instrument; strengthening his own power among the [[Patriar]].  In his heart, he cares deeply for the city, and [[The Amoni Concord]], and is seen as a great philanthropist; seeking to position himself and his family for the rank of [[Tribune]] one day.

He is one of the richest [[Patriar]] in [[Heliopolis]], and has gained the ear of the city's [[Tribune]] [[Appius Liberalis]].  Eliander's secret underworld connections allows him to control the flow of information and rumor within the city; using it to feed [[Appius Liberalis]] with just enough information to view Eliander as a trusted ally.

History has always been a love of Eliander's, and he is enamored by the culture of ancient civilizations such as [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]].  He seeks to revive the ancient [[Oeridian|The Oeridian Kingdoms]] city of [[Kararindi]], the first [[Human]] city of [[The Third Age]], and bring portions of [[Ruje]] back under the banner of [[The Amoni Concord]].

He has five children, his youngest daughter [[Carmilla Volkos]] was wed to [[Anders Quinticius Solmar]] in an arranged marriage of convenience in order for Eliander to solidify his hold on the shipping industry within the region of [[The Risen Reef]].

//I never understand my characters until I accept them as part of me. ''-Elizabeth Disbrow''//
}}}

[[Elizabeth Disbrow]], The First Elf, mistress of [[The Feywild]] and daughter of [[Brian Disbrow]] was raised with the stories of [[Asha]].  From her first forgotten characters that were princesses and sorceresses, to characters that would rise to the pantheon of [[The Gods]].  She specialized in [[The Planes Of Existence]], dreaming and having visions of them which at times conflicted with [[Brian Disbrow's|Brian Disbrow]] prophecies - overwriting his mythology with newfound truths.

!Notable Characters
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-stone-lands/brand/minerva-portrait.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Minerva Carrington]] |[[Minerva Carrington]] was Elizabeth's first character that was fully fleshed out and comprehensive.  It is a beloved character that [[Elizabeth Disbrow]] spent many hours crafting and thinking about.  [[The Grey Companions]] was time well spent between The Disbrow Family: [[Brian Disbrow]], [[Erin Disbrow]], [[Elizabeth Disbrow]] and [[Tyler Disbrow]]. She enjoyed this character so much, that she struggled giving it up and becoming another.  [[Minerva|Minerva Carrington]] taught Elizabeth confidence and the ability to ad lib and be free to improvise. |
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-isles/zylok/the-athenaeum/alana-underwood-portrait.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Alana Underwood]] |[[Alana Underwood]] was the mark of a new beginning for [[Asha]], as [[Elizabeth Disbrow]] asked [[Brian Disbrow]] to run a campaign with her high school friends [[Maika Danford]] and [[Megan Leino]].  They uncovered new history of [[Asha]] including [[The Planes Of Existence]] and [[The Whispered One]].  Elizabeth was able to express her anger and uncertainty for the future through [[Alana|Alana Underwood]].  [[Alana|Alana Underwood]] taught Elizabeth that it is important to enjoy the journey, even with when you have big audacious goals, and sometimes what you want isn't want you get.  |
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-elven-lands/the-high-forest/elethanori-portrait.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[ElethaNori]] |[[ElethaNori]] was the first [[Elf]] player character, a notable feat as [[Brian Disbrow]] was adamant that [[Elves|Elf]] were unplayable as their immortality granted them a deep knowledge of [[Asha]] that was unobtainable by any who haven't fully immersed themselves with the wiki.  [[Elizabeth Disbrow]] earned the right the play an [[Elf]] due to her many contributions to [[Asha]] lore. [[ElethaNori]] taught Elizabeth that she has an innate ability to mediate, resolve conflict, while at the same time holding firm to her own beliefs. |
| [img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/orpheous-portrait.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Orpheous]] |[[Orpheous]] was the first male character Elizabeth had played.  A twin to his brother [[Azarad]], who was played by [[Tyler Disbrow]].  [[Orpheous]] was kind-hearted, goofy, and protective of the other members of the party.  He began as a [[Barbarian]], then pivoted to [[Cleric]] at a pivotal moment of the campaign when everyone had experienced [[The Weeping]].  [[Orpheous]] taught Elizabeth that you could protect people without controlling them, and to find the humor and let loose with the little things. |</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/elvish-language.jpg]]
The Elvish language is both arcane and mysterious to outsiders, who equate the beautiful language akin to raindrops falling softly on smooth stones.  The [[Elves|Elf]] refer to their spoken word as the [[Efe]], or song.  Elvish still has a foothold in [[human civilization|Human]] as the root derivative of ancient names and places.  Often these names leftover of [[Elvish society|Elf]] have a transitive meaning to the [[humans|Human]], and are only kept for their esoteric value.

The language consists of 22 letters (5 vowels, 17 consonants).  The other unusual element in Elven language is the milanu, written as two small dots placed over the last vowel in the word.  All words end in vowels, the milanu makes the word plural.

!Guide To Pronunciation
Pronunciation is simple.  Pronounce A “ah” as in father, E “ay” as in weigh, I “ee” as in marine, O “oh” as in no, and U “oo” as in true.  Each vowel is pronounced separately.  Consonants mirror their English equivalents, with the exception of S.  When S is followed be E it is pronounced as if it were a Z (selle the Elvish word for nest is pronounced zella).  The consonant R should be trilled.  Vowels are never doubled.

!Common Sayings and Phrases
[[Kahedafa]] - &quot;dancing sword&quot; - a form of sword common in [[The Sylvan Empire]]
[[Gwainaira]] - &quot;New Child&quot; - an [[Elf]] born after [[The Third Desecration]]

It is a plane aligned to peace and tranquility, where [[Mortal Souls|Soul]] that have lived a good life migrate in their afterlife.  Elysium is structured into four regions, each with their own physical laws and properties.  It is ruled by [[The Apotheons|Apotheon]] and [[The Seven]].

| [img[images/locations/elysium/amoria-preview.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Amoria]]: [[The Pearly Heaven|Amoria]] |[[Amoria]], or more commonly known as [[The Pearly Heaven|Amoria]], is the first layer of Elysium.  It is a lush and verdant land with crops, meadows, moors, hills and rolling countryside bathed in the soft glow from a sky reminiscent of the luster of white pearls.  [[The Everlasting Spring]] flows through this layer known for its warm and soothing waters.  [[Amoria]] is designed to comfort newfound [[Souls|Soul]], and be a place to wait for their loved ones to arrive before migrating to [[Theros]].

| [img[images/locations/elysium/theros-preview.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Theros]]: [[The Blissful Heaven|Theros]] |[[Theros]], or more commonly known as [[The Blissful Heaven|Theros]], is the second layer of Elysium.  It is common for [[Souls|Soul]] to migrate here from [[Amoria]] when their [[Souls|Soul]] are properly prepared.  Here the [[AstraKashira]] call home, and the realm possesses a metaphysical property where things believed and dreamed eventually become true.  The collective unconscious of millions of [[Mortal Souls|Soul]] has the literal power of creation, though the process unfolds over the course of countless centuries.  [[The Radiant Guard]], former [[AstraKashira]] warriors for [[Lucian]] rest here and tend to mortals and to the land.|

The [[Souls|Soul]] form [[The Heavenly Chorus]], whose harmony and rhythm is tended to by the [[Auriel]] and the [[AstraKashira]].  The [[Chorus|The Heavenly Chorus]] is restless and discordant without the voices of [[Shalekasha]] and [[Malthael]].|

<pre>Enchantment is the arduous process of inscribing [[Residuum]] runes on items, and infusing them with [[Magical|Magic]] power.  Only [[Wizards|Wizardry]] and [[Sorcerers|Sorcery]] can imbue magical properties into objects in this way.

!The Reemergence Of Enchantment
It is the [[Elves|Elf]] of [[The Third Age|The Sylvan Empire]] who perfected Enchantment in a process they called Awakening.  For the [[Elves|Elf]], Enchantment was a pinnacle of achievement; and one that they feel nearly caused their [[Desecration]].  While the secrets of Enchantment have been lost to time, [[The Emerald Order]] seeks to keep it that way.

It was [[Nester Arkwood]] and [[Erik Doorhaus]] who saw to the resurgence of Enchantment in the 10th century [[AAP]].  They combined their knowledge of [[Wizardry]] and [[Sorcery]] to not only unlock the secrets of the [[Elves|Elf]], but quickly surpass them.  Now enchanted items are much more common across [[Asha]].

!Awakening
The [[Elves|Elf]] called the final process of Enchantment the Awakening.  If the Awakening is not performed exactly, the Enchantment will not be permanent.  Even worse, the item could take on properties and attributes that were unwanted or undesirable.

!Residuum and Heartstone
The mineral [[Cavorite]] is a critical component of Enchantment.  It must be refined into [[Residuum]] and used to inscribe runes into an object.  In time, these runes fade to normal vision; but can be seen with an Identify or Detect Magic spell.  [[Heartstone]] is made by combining [[Residuum]] with stone, creating a durable material that is capable of absorbing [[Magic]].</pre>

It took quite some time, but eventually he realized his true self was that of a [[Beaver]].  Endymion shape-changed into this form after encouragement from a teenage [[Artimas Meliger]] around the year 993 [[AAP]].  [[Artimas Meliger]] encouraged Endymion to live out ones inner feelings and desires, and to be true to oneself.

Endymion believes he is beloved by all of the people of [[Candlekeep]], but in truth he is a bit of an unintentional rascal.   He is so self absorbed and content in his [[Beaver]] form, that he is oblivious to the destruction he may cause.  Endymion is known to chew wooden fences and posts, free caged animals, or cut off water supplies by building random dams.

The local custom of [[Candlekeep]] is to celebrate [[Panathenaea]], a celebration of the harvest.  Traditionally, each family would sacrifice an animal as a token to the bounty.  Endymion was horrified by the senseless slaughter of innocent animals, and went about changing this practice.  As if a talking [[Beaver]] warning the townsfolk against killing animals wasn't enough, he also enacted a practice of delivering gifts to the locals who listened to his warnings.  This later grew to staggering proportions.

Endymion has an [[Enchanted|Enchantment]] pouch he calls [[The Pouch Of Offering]] which when wood or stone is placed inside, it can craft simple carvings.  The longer raw materials sit inside of the pouch, the higher the quality; if left long enough they may even possess a temporary magical quality.  Each year, Endymion uses this pouch to deliver gifts and has effectively replaced the celebration's connection to animal sacrifice.

It isn't often that Endymion travels into town, instead relying on his faithful [[Goblin]] servant [[Avidar]] to run errands.  When he does go into town, he can be seen peering into shop windows and has been accused of copying design ideas for [[The Pouch Of Offering]] from local artisans.  He is also known for loosing caged or fenced animals that he misinterprets to have gotten themselves trapped on their own and are in need of assistance.  Endymion is unaware of a nemesis named [[Vibius Castinus]] a [[Patriar]] who is a local soap maker.  The pine aroma of one of the specific soaps attracts Endymion, who loves the scent.  [[Vibius Castinus]] has found on multiple occasions [[Beaver]] fur within the pine soap, and accused Endymion of ruining the batch costing [[Vibius|Vibius Castinus]] money and customers.  Even though Endymion is known to cause mischief; all of it is unintentional and he is blind to it.

Endymion prefers not to wear clothes other than an ornate cape adorned with animal embroidery on its edges.  He is a very proud [[Beaver]], and he walks with the gait of royalty; his cape flaring out behind him.  Endymion has a flair for the dramatic, and prefers when attention is on him.  His fur is golden brown, lustrous, and well groomed; his teeth perfectly trimmed and sharp.  It is known that he manicures his claws so that they don't click on the ground when he walks.

Inside of the city of [[Candlekeep]] is an open wooded park known as [[The Candlekeep Prominade]].  It is within this area that Endymion lives, in a natural beaver dam that is on the small stream located here.  While the outside holds the appearance of a natural damn (if you ignore the chimney), the inside is quite cozy and appeals to the former [[Human]] within him.</pre>

Entar Arkstaff (992 [[AAP]] - Current) was born to Slaves who died performing in [[The Ampitheater]] of [[Bandor]].  Even as a child, it was clear that Entar was special - for he possessed an innate ability with [[Magic]]; but one he couldn't control.  His family has no history of [[Sorcery]], and his [[Wild Power|Wild Bloodline]] comes from an [[Unknown Source|Wild Bloodline]].

His [[magical powers|Sorcery]] manifested when he turned 13, when he was overcome with a [[Wild Magic Surge|Wild Bloodline]] out of his control.  While in [[Bandor's|Bandor]] marketplace and accosted by bullies who were chiding him, the stress cause a magical third eye to temporarily appear on his forehead, his form to grow to 8 feet tall, his body bathed in a sickly green aura, and his voice to boom.  The bullies, and all those nearby became sickened by the aura.  To add more mayhem, his uncontrolled channeling weakened the barrier between [[The Echo Planes]]; allowing a small band of [[Pixies|Pixie]] to break through from [[The Feywild]]; they began a spree of petty mischief that wouldn't be contained for over a week.

The event gained the notice of a local [[Sorcerer|Sorcery]] named [[Vephiar Aroscoa]], who purchased Entar from his current master and set about training him.  [[Vephiar|Vephiar Aroscoa]] treated Enter firmly, but never treating him as a slave.  Entar learned manners, as well as how to begin to control his [[Wild Magic|Wild Bloodline]] to a degree.  Before his master passed away, he saw to securing Enter's status as a free man; and passed his home and wealth to Entar, who he thought of as a son.

He currently serves as the oversser of [[The Amphitheater]], and the justice it delivers.</pre>

Erik Doorhaus (c. 1008 [[AAP]] to Current) was a player character run by [[Tyler Disbrow]].

Erik Doorhaus ([[Dwarvish]] for Iron Hammer) was born to [[Magnus Zizorum]] and [[Lyla Orosco]] during a dark [[Blood Magic]] ritual meant to kill Erik to prolong the life of [[Magnus Zizorum]].  Erik was rescued from the ritual by his aunt, [[Desini Orosco]], who brought him to [[The Grey Companions]] for aid.  Erik was hidden, and an intense battle ensued in which [[Magnus Zizorum]] was presumed dead.  Erik was then raised by [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] in the underground stronghold of [[Kulkar]].  At a very young age, Erik showed great potential in the magical arts of [[Sorcery]] - especially fire magic.  Living underground with the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], he could use his magic to see in the dark - or light up objects and rooms to make his stay comfortable.  Using his [[Magic]], Erik helped his [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] father at their blacksmith shop.

His dwarven parents [[Ulrich Doorhaus]] and [[Sigge Doorhaus]] loved him dearly and saw to his upbringing.  Without an adequate teacher, Erik consumed many books on the subject of magic and the occult.

When he reached the age of 12, his size and power were great enough for the clan leaders to suggest conscripting him into the militia.  [[Ulrich Doorhaus]] protested strongly, as Erik was still but a boy and was not near the age of ascension.  Conflict ensued in which [[Sigge Doorhaus]] was killed, and [[Ulrich Doorhaus]] was imprisoned - but not before he was able to see Erik safely to the surface with provisions.

Erik found his was to the city of [[Brand]], where he met up with [[Minerva Carrington]] and [[Desini Orosco]] and joined [[The Grey Companions]].  Erik grew to become the most powerful mage in [[Brand]], experimenting with all forms of magical arts such as [[Enchantment]].  He was the creator of what he called a [[Haven Bag]], which was a bag that could magically store contents larger than its interior as well as [[The Chrono Ocullum]] which was able to contort [[The Eternal Cycle]] itself.

Erin Disbrow, wife of [[Brian Disbrow]], dark sorceress of [[Asha's|Asha]] deeper mysteries, is an integral part of [[Asha's|Asha]] history.  While hesitant to share her understanding of the truths of her knowledge of the world, when she does they are often dark and disturbing (but true).  Much to the delight of [[Brian Disbrow]], she adds a spark that breathes life and detail into all of the creations of [[Asha]].  She is gifted with the ability and skill to paint realistic terrain and creatures that add to the immersive experience that brings [[Asha]] into [[The Material Plane]].  Her creations shape and define the lore of [[Asha]] as much as the lore of [[Asha]] shapes her creations.

!Notable Characters
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-keep/arroweed/celeste-holm-portrait.jpg][Celeste Holm]] &lt;br&gt; [[Celeste Holm]] |__[[Celeste Holm]]__ was Erin's first character ever in a role-playing game.  She played the character recklessly, even causing [[Celeste|Celeste Holm]] to decapitate someone with her magical claws shapeshifted into panther paws.  This caused Erin to realize she had a hunger for power and a thirst for fierce characters; a trait that continued to be shared by future characters of her creation.  [[Celeste Holm]] was on the run from [[The Divine Order]], and allowed Erin to cope with the fact that she had recently moved away from home and explore her newfound independence. |
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-stone-lands/brand/desini-orosco-portrait.jpg][Desini Orosco]] &lt;br&gt; [[Desini Orosco]] |__[[Desini Orosco]]__ was strong and powerful, with a streak of righteous anger.  Erin had to be more forceful in her playstyle because [[Elizabeth|Elizabeth Disbrow]] and [[Tyler|Tyler Disbrow]] were so young.  Erin felt like the kids were playing a game, and she was saving the world.  [[Desini|Desini Orosco]] was played at a time when Erin was juggling many things in life - a vice-president of the PTA, a loving mom, a college student, a diligent worker, and outstanding wife.  [[Desini|Desini Orosco]] remains close to Erin's heart and a fond memory, as she allowed Erin an outlet for her feelings. |
| [img[images/characters/uskard/aereon-zara-al-wali-portrait.jpg][Whyanne Loom]] &lt;br&gt;[[Aereon Zara Al-Wali]] |__[[Aereon Zara Al-Wali]]__ was played after Erin had a break from D&amp;D.  [[Brian|Brian Disbrow]] begged Erin to join the new campaign, stating that he needed her to balance the social dynamic.  Erin was so instrumental in creating and crafting ideas with him, and enjoyed the experience so much that [[Brian|Brian Disbrow]] wanted her to have the experience of playing.  [[Aereon|Aereon Zara Al-Wali]] let her once again explore the recklessness and passion that she felt with playing [[Celeste Holm]]; without the responsibility and pressure she felt with [[Desini Orosco]]. In fact, Erin gave full control of spells and abilities to [[Brian|Brian Disbrow]] or random choice; freeing Erin from the responsibility allowing her to go with the flow.  Erin always looked forward to the moments that [[Aereon|Aereon Zara Al-Wali]] would make contact with her [[Patron]], causing her to giggle with glee when her [[Patron's|Patron]] theme music would start. |
| [img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/tauksana-portrait.jpg][Tauksana]] &lt;br&gt; [[Tauksana]] |__[[Tauksana]]__ was Erin's first non-human character, filled with child-like wonder and excitement.  She took pleasure in chaos, and allowed Erin to explore a missing piece of her own childhood.  This made for more of an effect when that child-like wonder was ripped away from [[Tauksana]] during [[The Weeping]]. |</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/ethufaera.jpg]]

Ethufaera (346 [[IO]] to 966 [[AAP]]) (&quot;water magic&quot; in [[Elvish]]) was a [[Draugaira]] [[Elf]] that lived in the city of [[Tszanthus]] of [[Ruje]].  Through a combination of cunning, skill and charisma, Ethufaera ascended to become to leader of [[The Council Of Thieves]], instilling fear in some and loyalty in others.  His reputation as a master assassin garnered him respect even among his adversaries, who spoke of him in hushed tones, dubbing him &quot;The Shadow Whisper&quot; for his ability to strike without a trace.

Ethufaera's reign came to a mysterious and abrupt end.  Many believed that [[Shaarlaima]], his most skilled and ambitious protege has betrayed and eliminated him in order to seize control of the [[Breagan Datha]].  While the world understands him to be dead, the truth of his fate remains veiled.

Ethufaera sent his son [[EliaEthu-KalarMinu]] away to [[Amon]], to the ancient homeland of the [[Draugaira]] [[Elves|Elf]].  There, [[EliaEthu-KalarMinu]] would be shielded from the dangers of the underworld while receiving training in the ancient ways of their people.  His decision was driven by a desire to ensure his son understood the heritage of their people and could forge his own path away from the dark and treacherous world of assassins.  He hoped that [[EliaEthu-KalarMinu]] would be given the freedom to journey and discover his own strengths and honor the legacy of their ancestry.

!Breagan Datha
[[Breagan Datha]] is an exclusively [[Elven|Elf]] guild of assassins, and Ethufaera led the guild at a time that could be considered its &quot;golden age&quot;.  With Ethufaera's leadership the group rose in power and it was Ethufaera who forged [[The Council Of Thieves]] to eliminate the infighting that plagued the city's underworld.  He was known to be kind, amiable, and a peaceful person in his later years.  He fancied himself a philanthropist who sought to bring peace to the city, and actively avoided violence.  It did not mean he was weak or a coward, as he would use force and authority when necessary; however in his age he was also capable of forgiveness.  Ethufaera deeply loved his wife, and losing her affected him so much that he still could not forget her after she died in a complicated childbirth.  He was fond of making sculptures, spending time working on his model of the city of [[Tszanthus]].
 
!EliaEthu-KalarMinu
Ethufaera's wife died in childbirth due to complications.  It is said that the birth his son [[EliaEthu-KalarMinu]] made him soft.  Realizing his position was dangerous, Ethufaera sent his son away to [[Amon]] for protection as well as to escape the dark life he would have lived if he remained in the city.

!The Vault Of Ethufaera
After he was killed by his protege [[Shaarlaima]], it became clear that Ethufaera took many secrets to his grave.  One of the most clever individuals in [[Tszanthus]], the exorbitant wealth and secrets he was known to posses were never found.  The legend of a secret [[Vault|The Vault Of Ethufaera]] began to swell.</pre>

Faeratha (&quot;Spirit Guide&quot; in [[Elvish]]) are figments of the spirit of [[Valouria]], waiting for their turn in [[The Eternal Cycle]].  It is rare for them to be seen, as they are both rare and shy.  They are found in remote locations of [[Asha]] where nature remains relatively untouched by the trappings of civilization.

They are 6 inches tall, and appear as chubby fur covered bipedal creatures with stubby appendages, antlers on their heads, and masks as faces.  No two Faeratha share the same mask, which cannot be removed; it resembles their unique personality.

These tiny spirits are babies, awaiting their turn in [[The Eternal Cycle]] where they may evolve into full formed spirits and enter the body of a new living being.  Their prior life was in a plant or other simple form; their life as a Faeratha earned through [[Karma]].

They are incapable of speech, but are naturally curious of living beings.  They spend their short lives mimicking behavior of creatures; such as swimming like a fish, jumping like a rabbit, and trying to fly like a bird (which they can't).  The smallest amount of damage causes them to blink out of existence and into [[Sene'Rine'Rada]], where they slumber until they can regain enough energy to reform days later to begin the cycle anew.  Faeratha are usually solitary creatures, but when more than one gather their playfulness increases exponentially.  This often escalates to good-natured mischief as their frolicking get out of hand.

Faeratha have natural camouflage that makes them difficult to see.  When they stand still, they are completely hidden.  They also have the ability to shift in and out of [[Sene'Rine'Rada]] at will, making them invisible to living creatures when in the Dream World.  They may choose to reveal themselves to those with a gentle heart that are attuned to [[Valouria]].  Terrified of the effects from [[Blood Magic]], the Faeratha are repelled by those who have [[Corruption]].  They make themselves known with the playful sound of bamboo wind chimes, often followed with a natural phenomenon such as a gust of wind.</pre>

[[Eidolon]], or less formally &quot;Familiars&quot; are spirit companions that are summoned by a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] that take the form of an animal.  A [[Wizard|Wizardry]] has a bond with their Familiar; they can learn to communicate telepathically, use their senses, as well as cast some spells through them.

!Spirits From Beyond
Familiars are spirits from [[The Shadowfell]] or [[The Feywild]], yet they arrive in the form of a common animal such as a Toad, Cat, or Ferret.  In rare occasions, the spirit arrives in its natural form of a creature from [[The Feywild]] or [[The Shadowfell]].  It is possible to use [[Magic]] to alter the form of the Familiar, but it's natural state is that of what it arrives in when the [[Wizard|Wizardry]] first summons them.

!A Strong Bond
The bond between a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] and their Familiar is strong, each being an extension of the other.  This bond can never be broken once created.  Each can sense the other, and knows when they have died or have been hurt, and generally can sense the direction the other is in.

When a Familiar is reduced to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form.  The Familiar is not technically dead, and instead returns to its natural Plane of origin, awaiting to be summoned once again by the bonded [[Wizard|Wizardry]].  However, it is possible for a Familiar to die of age, as it’s spirit fades over time (roughly 75 - 100 years).  When a Familiar’s spirit fades, they are gone forever and the [[Wizard|Wizardry]] can not summon another Familiar ever again.

You can't have more than one Familiar at a time.  If you cast the Find Familiar spell while you already have a Familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form of your choosing.

!A Symbiotic Relationship
Your Familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands.  In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn.  A Familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

A Familiar and its master share in a symbolic relationship and are connected empathetically.  The Familiar’s personality and behavior mimic who they are linked to.  The rhythms and needs of the two entities become synchronized: when the master is hungry, so is the Familiar;  when the Familiar feels pain, so does the master.  This relationship grants a series of reciprocal powers that each may benefit from.

!Eidolon Abilities
As a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] levels up, the supernatural bond between them and their Familiar grows.  These advancements manifest at 1st, 3rd, 5th,11th, and 17th level.  Any abilities you receive instantly re removed when your Familiar dies.</pre>

Some [[Fey]] of [[The Feywild]] experience an ethereal and profound bond with another living creature; a connection that intertwines both of their spiritual progress in ways both deep and mysterious.  This extraordinary soulmate is known as a Fated.  Upon meeting one's Fated, a [[Fey's|Fey]] heart fills with passion and unwavering certainty.  This is a bond that all [[Fey]] strive to achieve and is considered the pinnacle of emotional and spiritual fulfillment.  [[Fey]] commonly feel this connection for someone they meet for the first time.

!A Profound Connection
Those who are Fated share a unique and profound connection that goes beyond the physical and emotional realm.  Described as a co-mingling of souls, this connection spans across lifetimes and surpasses the limits of the current physical existence.  The Fated understand each other on a profound level, accepting each other's flaws and strengths without judgement.  It is a connection that brings a sense of completeness and mutual understanding, elevating it far above the ordinary relationships known to the [[Fey]].  Once cemented, a Fated can always sense when their soulmate is dead, and this awareness is often accompanied with great mourning that can last for decades.

!Destined To Be Together
The union of the Fated is not merely a chance encounter; it is a destiny inscribed within [[The Eternal Cycle]].  This preordained connection transcends time and circumstance, manifesting as a love that is unconditional and enduring.  This love endures any challenges and difficulties that may arise, remaining resilient and unyielding.</pre>

Fazar was born with the gift of [[Sorcery]].  It is said that he was of noble birth in the region now known as [[The Keep]].  He practiced with sword and lance as often as he did [[Magic]], making him widely known as the Wizard Knight.  He perfected the ruthless combination of sorcery and mastery of arms.

At the age of 22 he commanded an army into [[Orcish Lands]], using his [[Magic]] to turn the very land asunder.  He was legendary for entering battles with no armor, growing to gigantic proportions, and turning his skin as hard as stone.  He was known as &quot;Nigund&quot; in the [[Black Speech]], meaning &quot;stone one&quot; - and was much feared.

For years he pushed back the [[Orc]], who were amassing for war.  He returned home to a heroes welcome, until he received word from [[Armondax]] and [[Mysara]] that an even darker threat had been rising on Fazar's home soil.  [[The Demon Plague]] was in full effect, and [[The Holy Scourge]] had the world in its evil clutches.  Weary from war, Fazar commanded his [[Mage Guard]] to march - 1,000 of his soldiers who were equally proficient in sword and sorcery.  [[Cyril Viridian]], raised another 5,000 warriors.  It was these two armies that are thought to have been the rising tide of victory against [[The Holy Scourge]].

After they were victorious, [[Mysara]], [[Armondax]], Fazar and [[Waywill]] founded what is now known as [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]] in response to the [[Azutan Nagyos]], a war against magic by [[Cyril Viridian]] himself - who had overthrown the government and installed himself as [[Emperor]].  A new battle raged on - between practitioners of [[Magic]] and [[Cyril Viridian]].  A disgust for [[Magic]] had permeated the land, due to the events of [[The Demon Plague]] and [[The Destruction Of Uskard]], which saw a surge of [[Uskardeen]] refugees come to [[Kellos]].  After a few years of fighting, the [[Azutan Nagyos]] ended - and magic was no longer outlawed.

In the peaceful years that followed, Fazar fades from the historic record - it is assumed he died at a young age.</pre>

Today he is over 170 years old, hard of hearing and struggles with the more advanced spells.

His [[Wizard|Wizardry]] [[Familiar]] was a female cat named [[Gillian]], who faded away back to [[The Feywild]] over 70 years ago.  He missed her very much, and has experimented multiple times in order to get her back.  Once instance he inadvertently split his own self into multiple animals, needing to be rescued by students of his good friend [[Barnabus Diggle]].

Fenwick's home is a tower in [[The Garden District]] of [[Zylok]] which he enchanted to appear shorter at larger distances.  Only when you are right upon it, does the full four stories of the circular tower come into full view.  Fenwick can't remember how he made this happen - but is sure he documented it somewhere in his vast collection of personal notes and journals.  His spellbook is extremely large and full of half thought through spells, experiments and interesting ideas - and it spans a collection of books that he keeps in his laboratory.

He was renown as an [[Alchemist|Alchemy]] but he retired many years ago, and only practices magic for his own enjoyment.

Fenwick's tower is locked by a front door enchanted with an arcane lock, however Fenwick continues to forget the password and often uses the [[Knock]] spell to enter.  Unfortunately, his security system is a magical set of armor which attacks anyone who enters without the password - even Fenwick himself.  Therefore, Fenwick doesn't leave his house very often because replacing the armor is costly.

Fenwick enjoys wearing outdated fashions which include a tall pointy hat and colorful exotic robes with moons and stars embroidered on them.</pre>

<pre>Feudalism is the combination of legal and military customs in [[The Viridian Empire]] prominent after the fall of [[The Old Republic]].  It is a means of structuring society around the holding of land and the exchange of land for the promise of service or labor.

!Status
Status in [[The Viridian Empire]] is hierarchical in nature, and heavily weighted towards birthright and [[Noble Blood|Roleplaying A Noble]].  It is possible (albeit rare) for a commoner to achieve the status of [[Knight]] or even [[Lord]], but status higher than this is virtually unobtainable without the correct [[family name|Houses Of The Viridian Empire]].

There is a hierarchy of titles and positions, each conferring a higher level of status and respect:

| !Level | !Title |

<div title="Fey" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202107252126" modified="202409050114" tags="race" changecount="61">
<pre>Fey is a general term describing creatures that originate from [[The Feywild]].  These creatures tend to have a strong connection to nature, and possess supernatural-like abilities not found typically on [[The Material Plane]].  Fey are proud, clever, deceiving, and typically abide by strict codes of conduct.  Being pure fragments of [[Valouria's|Valouria]] spirit, most Fey have tenancies towards mild insanity; as they are missing their rational mind.

They Fey are separated into seven classifications: [[The Fair Folk]], [[The Shy Folk]], [[The Wild Folk]], [[The Small Folk]], [[The Tall Folk]], [[The Kin Folk]], and [[The Fell Folk]]

| [&gt;img[images/races/fey/fairfolk/eldarin-portrait.jpg][The Fair Folk]] |__[[The Fair Folk]]__ are all beings who are tall and slender, possessing an otherworldly grace.  Their features are finely chiseled, and their eyes gleam with ancient wisdom.  It is [[The Fair Folk]] who seek to bring order and structure to [[The Feywild]] - each of the [[Archfey]] belonging to [[The Fair Folk]].  This classification includes the [[Eldarin]], and even the [[Hags|Hag]].  [[Elves|Elf]] of [[The Material Plane]], were created by [[Lucian]] using a spark from [[The Feywild]], granting them many characteristics of [[The Fair Folk]]; returning to [[The Feywild]] upon death. |
| [&gt;img[images/races/fey/smallfolk/korred-portrait.jpg][The Small Folk]] |__[[The Small Folk]]__ all embody whimsy and playfulness.  Despite their diminutive size, they each have a strong connection to the [[Magic]] of [[The Feywild]] and are often accomplished [[Sorcerers|Sorcery]] or [[Magicians|Wizardry]].  They delight easily, and their music, dance and laughter resonates through the enchanted glades of [[The Feywild]].  [[Korred]], [[Pixies|Pixie]], [[Sprites|Sprite]], and [[Satyrs|Satyr]] are all members of [[The Small Folk]].  They are curious and secretive, eager to collect items and knowledge unknown to others. |
| [&gt;img[images/bestiary/nymph-portrait.jpg][The Shy Folk]] |__[[The Shy Folk]]__ are intricately tied to the nature of [[The Feywild]], both physically and spiritually.  They the mercurial and childlike spirits of [[The Feywild]], beginning as fleeting lights, gentle breezes, or whispers in the wind - then manifesting in physical form with age and experience.  They physically resemble their environment, and are fierce protectors of it.  [[Nymphs|Nymph]], [[Dryads|Dryad]], [[Naiads|Naiads]], [[Nereids|Nereids]], [[Oreads|Oread]], [[Fossergrims|Fossergrim]] and  [[Wendigos|Wendigo]] are all [[Shy Spirits Of The Feywild|The Shy Folk]]. |
| [&gt;img[images/bestiary/unicorn-portrait.jpg][The Wild Folk]] |__[[The Wild Folk]]__ epitomize the untamed essence of [[The Feywild]].  Noble and primal, they possess an imposing and majestic presence that inspires awe.  [[The Wild Folk]] seamlessly integrate with the natural world; they are not simply inhabitants of [[The Feywild]], but an integral part of its ecosystems.  Their movements, actions, and very existence allow [[The Feywild]] to thrive.  Key members of [[The Wild Folk]] are the [[Unicorn]], [[Changeling]] and the [[Phoenix]]. |
| [&gt;img[images/bestiary/treant-portrait.jpg][The Tall Folk]] |__[[The Tall Folk]]__ are the gentle giants of [[The Feywild]].  Tall, massive beings that are slow in movement but radiate kindness and fairness.  Acting as benevolent shepherds of the other flora and fauna of [[The Feywild]], they take deliberate care in grooming their environment to encourage it to grow and flourish.  Most common in [[The Tall Folk]] are the [[Treants|Treant]]. |
| [&gt;img[images/races/fey/kinfolk/owlin-portrait.jpg][The Kin Folk]] |__[[The Kin Folk]]__ are a diverse group of sentient, humanoid beasts who embody the harmonious blend of animalistic traits and [[Fey]] wisdom.They are respected for their deep connection to nature and the [[Feywild's|The Feywild]] primal energies, and represent the balance between the wild and the civilized. [[The Kin Folk]] are known for their steadfastness, community-oriented values, and a profound respect for the natural order. They are often seen as protectors of their domains, nurturing the lands they inhabit and guiding other beings with a quiet, enduring strength. |
| [&gt;img[images/races/fey/fellfolk/goblin-portrait.jpg][The Fell Folk]] |__[[The Fell Folk]]__ are a chaotic and unpredictable group of [[Fey]], who are driven by their base desires, much like unruly children.  Their insatiable need to satisfy their impulses often leads them to acts of cruelty, mischief, and chaos without heed to consequences. Their lack of restraint and disregard for the well-being of others make them dangerous and feared throughout [[The Feywild]].  Serving the [[Fomorians|Fomorian]], they indulge in their whims with reckless abandon, spreading disorder and unrest wherever they go. [[Goblins|Goblin]], [[Hobs|Hob]], [[Bugbears|Bugbear]], and [[Gremlins|Gremlin]] are members of [[The Fell Folk]]. |

!The Fated
The Fey understand that a person's spiritual progress is unknowingly intertwined with that of a single other being.  This soulmate is called a [[Fated]].  Upon meeting their [[Fated]], a Fey's heart fills with passion and certainty.  Some Fey can go their whole life without meeting their [[Fated]], while other suffer greatly under the crushing weight that comes from the death of one's soulmate.

!Fey Weaknesses
While Fey vary greatly, they all share in common a set of weaknesses.  These weaknesses brand a create Fey.  There are some Fey though, like [[Unicorns|Unicorn]] who are not affected by some, or even most of these weaknesses, however.
|''Iron'' |Nearly all Fey are burned by iron.  A Fey creature that comes in contact with iron is greeted with pain and fire.  A Fey's blood burns on contact with this metal, and the &quot;iron death&quot; is one of the most painful ways for a Fey to die.  It is difficult to bring iron into [[The Feywild]], and most natural ways will close up around creatures carrying it. |
|''Running Water'' |Running water in any form, a river or the ocean, has many effects on the Fey.  Most Fey, except [[The Shy Folk]] and [[Unicorns|Unicorn]] cannot cross running water without temporarily losing their powers. |
|''Thresholds'' |To mortals, the threshold between an intelligent creature's home and the outside represent a loose term.  To the Fey, thresholds are real and powerful barriers.  These areas are created naturally and form over time after a creature builds walls and doors to keep others out.  Happy homes full of life have strong thresholds, while homes of lonely people or temporary dwellings have little to no threshold.  Unless invited in, Fey creatures must temporarily leave a portion of their power behind before crossing a threshold. |


!Tokens and Gifts
Fey enjoy receiving gifts for the respect and power it confers.  They believe there is power in some items, and enjoy owning other creature's sentimental trinkets; but have a fluctuating desire for these items that can fade quickly.  Accepting anything from a Fey would count as taking a gift from them, and in turn would put a creature in their debt.  Likewise, saving a Fey's life would put them in debt.  Debts are considered binding, and are magically binding when made within [[The Feywild]].  A Fey hates having a debt hanging over them, and will stop at nothing to remove it immediately or avoid it altogether.

!One True Name
Names hold power over the Fey, like all immortal beings; their name being granted to them by their creator.  A Fey's [[True Name]] belongs uniquely to them, and can be used by their creator to control them.  Fey typically go by aliases made from [[Elvish]] words.

!Break No Oaths
The Fey deal in absolutes.  While similar to promises, oaths hold strong power.  Breaking an oath has grave consequences which could lead to The Fey's demise.  Because of this, The Fey rarely make oaths or vows.</pre>

Those [[Planetouched]] by [[The Feywild]] are known as The Feylost, or The Feytouched.  Exposure to the [[Magic]] of [[The Feywild]] has changed your bloodline permanently.

Travelers to [[The Feywild]] are subjected to the powerful forces of [[that plane|The Feywild]] and are usually permanently changed by the experience.  Even after a Feytouched finally returns to their home [[Plane|The Planes Of Existence]], they are haunted by thoughts of [[The Feywild]].  Although memories of [[The Feywild]] grow fainter with each passing day, their heart swells with a mixture of both fear and joy at the prospect of one day venturing back to [[The Plane Of Faerie|The Feywild]].

Starting on the eve of the new year, a sanctified golden torch (a holy relic of the church) is ignited.  The following day, [[The Saint]] grants audience to all who wish to meet with him.  None are turned away, and he sees everyone who waits.  The torch is then extinguished when the last audience has been granted.  [[The Saint]] then returns back to his temple in [[Deepwater]].

!Introduction
The Flagon is an inn/tavern located in the heart of downtown [[Laranor]].  It is often recognized as one of the best inn’s in the city.  [[Finnigan Flak]] runs the Flagon, a former [[Darkling Cloak]] who has given up his underworld existence.  The employees are very attentive to their customers, and [[Finnigan Flak]] keeps a close eye on all of his patrons.  Having a large [[Troll]] on the premises ([[Grub]]) does wonders for keeping customers in line.

!Ground Floor
The ground floor has a large room with tables and chairs to seat patrons who wish a meal, and a large bar that can seat the clientele interested in savoring [[Finnigan Flak]]’s choice liquors.  [[Grub]] ([[Flak’s|Finnigan Flak]] [[Troll]] bodyguard) often takes a seat at the end of the bar, and is generally found alone (simply because everyone is afraid to sit near him).

The ground floor also has a small common room where beds and lockers are available for those wishing to stay overnight cheaply.  Cost is 6 copper a night.  A public hot bath is available to those in the common room.
The kitchen is also located on the ground floor.  All perishables are stored in the basement, but two large stoves are located here.

!Basement
The basement is accessed by a spiral staircase in the back of the kitchen.  The main room in the basement houses table and chairs for the employees to lounge and eat.  Also some storage that overflowed from the two storage rooms.  [[Finnigan Flak]] also keeps his wood here for the stoves in the kitchen.  There are two rooms for storage: one houses all of the liquor, the other crates of food stuffs.  [[Finnigan Flak]] highly prizes his liquor stores.  [[Finnigan Flak]]’s personal bedroom is also found in the basement.  There are a few books on a nightstand, and a large leather reading chair.  Nothing of immediate value is found here.  He always keeps a knife under his pillow.

[[Finnigan Flak]]’s office is located near his bedroom.  It is always kept locked (with a complex lock, -3 to skill).  The office has a nice wooden desk, and leather office chair.  Also murals decorate the north wall, and bookcases decorate the south wall.  Two suits of armor guard the doorway.

There is a secret room that is accessed through the office, by means of the bookcases.  This secret room houses all of [[Finnigan Flak]]’s valuables.  Gold, jewels, weapons, and a few more suits of armou.  There is also a bed and enough food for someone to be hid away for nearly 2 weeks.

!Second Floor
The second floor contains all of the rooms for rent.  There is another common room like the one found on the ground floor, which costs 5 copper a night.

A single room (containing a bed and a cupboard) can be rented for 10 copper a night.  The patron is issued a key for their room. There are 9 single rooms.  A double room (containing two beds, and two footlockers) can be rented for 15 copper a night.  The patron is issued a key for their room.  There are 6 double rooms.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/fey/fairfolk/fomorian.jpg]]
The Fomorians are former [[Eldarin]], transformed into monstrous, deformed beings.  They are feared throughout [[The Feywild]] for their cruelty and strength.  Their bodies appear to be almost randomly distributed; with warty and misshapen heads.  Many have limbs of varying sizes.

Most Fomorians live upon a floating island in [[The Feywild]] known as [[BaraDore]] (or &quot;Black Fog&quot; in [[Elvish]]), and are filled with greed and selfish desires.  The richest and most noble of the Fomorians collect memories and use their power to temporarily change their appearance to be pleasing.</pre>

<div title="Forana'loloKashira" creator="Jeremy Berse" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="201201060333" modified="202201221219" tags="race" changecount="38">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/forana-lolo-kashira.jpg]]
The Forana’loloKashira are tall, slender humanoids (determine height normally and add 3”, weight is 10 pounds less than normal).  They grow hair only on their heads, usually gold or silver and kept long.  Their features are striking but delicate, with pointed ears and almond shaped eyes.  They wear beautiful clothing often adorned with silk and flowers, and are often referred to as Wood Elves.

!Slender And Graceful
With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beutiful to [[Humans|Human]] and members of many other [[Races]].

!Self Isolation Within Hidden Realms
The Forana’loloKashira are an ancient race dating back to [[The Third Age]].  They descend from the [[Third Age Elves]] of [[The Sylvan Empire]] who heeded the warnings of [[Raime Wesewierë]] and fled the cities before [[The Third Desecration]].  For centuries now they have lived quietly in the forests of [[Asha]], keeping away from the affairs of [[man|Human]].  The Forana’loloKashira have no real form of government, in [[Human]] terms.  Their [[Havens]] are overseen by a Council of Elders, as well as a group known as [[Holnobalga|The Emerald Order]] or &quot;[[The Emerald Order]]&quot;.  [[The Emerald Order]] is tasked with censoring [[Magic]] and science to prevent the Elves from causing another [[Desecration]]. It is a mystery to all but the Wood Elves how their [[Havens]] don’t simply give in to anarchy.

!Inner Peace
Although [[The Sylvan Empire]] is dead and the [[Havens]] of the Forana’loloKashira are independent of one another, there is a bond between all of the Wood Elves.  Their firm belief in the [[Larabira]] and [[BahaUlla Prophecy]] written in [[The Third Age]] grants them a serenity and inner peace unequaled within any other of the [[Races]].  Their immortality also affords them a more intimate knowledge of [[The Eternal Cycle]] and they believe that a great peace will one-day be sustained, their [[Havens]] will grow to cover [[Asha]], and rather than end with a desecration, [[The Eternal Cycle]] will be broken and eternal peace and prosperity will be had by all once again.  This new age will bring about peace in such a way that [[The Gods]] have not yet seen: the lion will sleep with the lamb, and the creatures of the earth will cease to eat of the flesh of one another.  All living beings will live in harmony with themselves, and death will be a memory.

!Dabblers and Artists
The Wood Elves live pleasantly among the animals in the forest.  The highest responsibility of life is to protect the woodlands in which they live.  Everything, even their own well being and that of the [[Variona'Sha]], is second to that.  Most of their days are spent tending to their tree homes and gardens.  Many practice [[Magic]] and some even a bit of swordplay or archery.  But all enjoy the festivities of the night.  Every night the Forana’loloKashira have feasts of dancing, drinking and song (a great number of Forana’loloKashira have alcoholism and related disadvantages).  Most of what they require is produced within the forest.  They grow food in their gardens, make weapons of wood, and are especially skilled makers of wines and ales.

!The Variona'Sha
The Forana’loloKashira culture is tangled with that of the [[Variona'Sha]], or Bronze Elves, who protect Forana'loloKashira [[Havens]] from harmful intrusion. The wood elves never meddle in affairs outside of their [[Havens]], however owe a great debt to the [[Variona'Sha]] and would come to their aid when it is needed (although the [[Variona'Sha]] have never asked for help).

Fornum Gunderbum is a [[Gafflinz]], or [[Gnome]] who is a faculty member of [[The Athenaeum]] who teaches [[Races of Asha|Races]] to the students there.  He is over 600 years old born in 404 [[AAP]], and was brought to [[The Athenaeum]] by [[Nester Arkwood]] in 995 [[AAP]].  He has lived at the school since, and is often caught mumbling about the fact he is &quot;roughing it&quot; without the amenities he is used to where he is from.

He is one of the most friendly and kind teachers, willing to spend nearly unlimited amounts of time with students answering their questions with excruciating detail.  Often this leaves the questioner more confused and with more questions that they are afraid to ask for fear he will never stop.  When teaching, he is known to hunch over his board and write in very small hand writing that fills the board.  He is quite nimble for his size, and uses a ladder to quickly navigate the board and can write incredibly quickly with both hands simultaneously.  Without warning he is known to erase the whole board, to the astonishment and horror of note taking students.  [[Professor]] Gunderbum is known to spend hours describing simple topics to the boredom of the class, and then gloss over the most complex items as if they were common knowledge.

Fornum Gunderbum is eccentric and a tinkerer at heart.  Often he parades around the campus with some new overly complex gadget he cobbled together with scraps, complaining he can't finish it because he needs some obscure part only found in his [[homeland|The Wilds]].  When cornered, he will explain how he is not receiving the funding he requires from the [[Headmaster]] on the new wing of the school he desires in order to continue his tinkering.  He is fascinated with the behavior of the students and faculty.  There are occasionally rumors and reports that people catch glimpses of [[Professor]] Gunderbum lurking and observing ordinary encounters and taking notes.  He is only seen for a split second and vanishes, causing the onlooker to doubt he was there at all.

Fornum Gunderbum was a Scholar in the city of [[Aduztuac]] in [[The Wilds]].  He was known for his study of [[Humanology]] and the short history of [[The Material Plane]], often adopting odd mannerisms and customs like handshakes.  With his colleague, [[Frabnac Felbo]], they endeavored to study [[Magic]] and the [[Gafflinz]] natural Magical Resistance.  It became clear to Fornum quickly that the only way to complete the work accurately was to do so in the field, on [[The Material Plane]].  [[Frabnac Felbo]] refused to travel, as he couldn't bear to live without his gadgets and rough-it in the wild; although he assisted Fornum in requesting the needed funds for the expedition.  Fornum still send encrypted status reports to [[Frabnac Felbo]], who over the years has elevated himself to [[Professor]] of [[Aduztuac]].</pre>

Frederick is the head of [[House Carrington]].  His family was massacred by the [[Vampire]] [[Martin Blackbriar IV|Martin Blackbriar]] during the chaos that was [[The Siege Of Derby]] in 1003 [[AAP]] when Frederick was a toddler.  [[Martin Blackbriar]] took Frederick and his mother [[Derya Carrington]] as captives, using his vile abilities to charm them into submission.  After [[Derya Carrington]] threw herself from the top of the castle tower, Frederick was alone.  He was physically and emotionally tortured, used as a pawn in [[Blackbriar's|Martin Blackbriar]] scheme to hide his true nature from the world and assume Frederick's identity when convenient for him.

[[The Grey Companions]] killed [[Martin Blackbriar]] in 1021 [[AAP]], freeing the ancestral home of [[House Carrington]] and Frederick from his evil.  After being released from the [[Vampire's|Vampire]] grip he still feels trapped in the fact that he is uncomfortable as the [[Lord]] of [[Hagen]].  He feels lost in the number of decisions required of him, and lacks the confidence in his ability to lead.</pre>

|![[Click Here For Information on the Gafflinite Language|Gafflinite]]|
The Gafflinz (or gnomes) are a short and slight race.  They stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, similar to [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] but tend to be less well built.  They stand 2 feet shorter than a [[Human]] of equivalent strength and have 6 fingers on each hand (Gafflinz have a second thumb located on the opposite side of their palm).  They are normally bald, but may have tufts of hair on the top of their heads.  They grow thin beards the colors commonly found among [[humanity|Human]].  Their skin is pale and their facial features are broad and flat.  Their eyes vary in colors considered unnatural by many races (purple, gold, pink, bright red, white and silver). 

!From Another World
The ancestors of the Gafflinz were transported to [[Asha]] during [[The Cataclysm]] of [[The Second Age]], ripped from their home.  In a failed attempt to return to whence they came, they created [[The Wilds]] - where they currently reside.  It is very rare for a Gafflinz to be found outside of the protection this dimensional space gives.  The Gafflinz dedication to social and cultural isolation has worked perfectly for millennia.  Their inventions, research, knowledge, skills, and even their language is unknown to the other races of Asha.

!Secrets Made, Secrets Kept
Gafflinz are gatherers of information, inventors, and scholars.  Gafflinz horde knowledge, and never share their [[creations|Gafflinz Inventions]] or wisdom with other [[races|Races]].  They are suspicious of all other [[races|Races]], but curious at the same time.  With their fondness and thirst for information, it is not uncommon for a Gafflinz to be extremely chatty on subjects that would be considered boring to those not of the same mentality.  Gafflinz culture is very secretive.  They keep their customs, lives, cities, and people hidden from all outsiders.  The Gafflinz written language is actually written using a complex cipher, requiring Cryptoanalysis skills to read.  Their cities and written language have been out of reach (even through magic means) due to the sheer diligence of the Gafflinz to remain isolated.

Gafflinz are eager to organize into secret societies and orders in order to safeguard their knowledge.  Most notable are [[The Society Of The Faded Orb]], [[The Order Of The Stark Well]], [[The Order Of The Invincible Throne]], and [[The Order Of The Silent Divide]].

!Technologically Advanced
The Gafflinz have access to levels of technology unheard of on [[Asha]].  They understand the concept of gears, clockworks, and steam power.  This level of engineering is something they would never consider sharing with the &quot;lesser&quot; [[Races]] (meaning anyone who isn't a Gafflinz).  Each of their cities within [[The Wilds]] is connected to a central collective intelligence known as [[The Aug]].  Gafflinz may gift knowledge to [[The Aug]], allowing that knowledge to become part of the general understanding of the race.  Gafflinz can interact with [[The Aug]] verbally, asking and answering questions.

!Roughing It
It should be noted that while Gafflinz may be encountered (albeit rarely) outside of their forbidden cities, they are actively engaged in research and observation.  A Gafflinz may be on a stakeout, eyeing the comings and goings and daily events of a [[Human]] city.  Sometimes the observers remain hidden behind a makeshift camouflage net or barrier, in the same way a [[Human]] might observe an animal in its natural habitat.   Never would an average Gnomish citizen venture out of their city, only a handful of researchers may attend expeditions outside of the city walls - doing so would be considered &quot;Roughing It&quot;.

!Magical Resistance
Gafflinz have a very strong [[Magic Resistance]], which renders them nearly immune to all but the strongest magic.  The source of this resistance is unknown even to the Gafflinz, but they still devote massive amounts of effort into the study of possible causes.  In the meantime, their magical resistance hampers others from using malicious means of extracting secrets from these isolationist’s brains.

!Bureaucracy
The Gafflinz elect officials to oversee their cities, which they call [[Professors|Gafflinz Professors]].  The [[Professors|Gafflinz Professors]] and their appointed [[Council|Gafflinz Council]] serve for a period of ten years.  The [[Professors|Gafflinz Professors]] and council approve and fund all research and development that is performed by the citizens of the city.  It is well within their right to cease funding on a particular project, and concentrate the city's efforts in a more promising direction.

//I have reflected, and I choose to do what my father did not.  By my decree, from this moment forward, I abolish slavery across The Empire.

All of those in bondage within The Viridian Empire are hereby free, and considered full citizens of The Empire with my blessing.

I also seek to expand the mercy of The Empire to include all races within our bounds.  Be them Dwarf, Elf, Bairn, Human, Tabaxi, Dragonborn, Gafflinz, Jotnar, and even Orc.  We are all children of Asha, and must seek a means to coexist in peace if we are to prosper.  The prosperity of one is the prosperity of all.  My personal goal is to unite the races together in a coalition of peace.  I will convene the first unilateral - multi-racial council that seeks to gather together, discuss common problems and find shared solutions that benefit all of the sentient races of The Empire.

''-Galad Jedaleon''  1026 [[AAP]]
}}}

Galad Jedaleon (1006 [[AAP]] - current) is the [[Emperor]] of [[The Viridian Empire]]. Ruler of the [[Kell]], the [[Amoni]], the [[Uskardeen]], and the [[Orc]]. He is [[Marshall]] of [[The Keep]], [[Shield]] of [[Deepwater]] and head of [[House Jedaleon]]. He is a tall and handsome young man, everything an [[Emperor]] should be. He strives hard to achieve, due to the incompetence of his younger brother (whom Galad Jedaleon loves dearly). He is working very hard to continue his father’s dream of prosperity across [[Kellos]] by abolishing Slavery in 1026 [[AAP]], and his personal goal is to unite the [[Races]] of [[Kellos]]: [[Dwarf]], [[Elf]], [[Bairn]], [[Human]], and [[Orc]] in a council of peace.

He excels at everything he sets out to accomplish.  Trained by [[Garet Napier]] in swordplay, he can best many of [[The Knights Of Deepwater]] in one on one combat.  [[Rolo Cavat]] taught him battlefield tactics, and how to command armies and naval ships; and [[Rolo|Rolo Cavat]] to this day talks about how quickly he picked it up.  Despite his tremendous skill, Galad secretly does not wish to be [[Emperor]], but continues because his brother is not of the quality to assume the throne.  He instead just wishes to be left alone rather than have the weight of [[Kellos]] on his shoulders.

His mother [[Katerin Karbold]] died in 1017 [[AAP]] when Galad was 11 years old.  His fondest memory of her is when she would play her harp as a lullaby to him and his brother [[Greco Jedaleon]].  She would always play the song [[Remember My Tears]] to put him to sleep.  After her death, Galad learned to play that song in her honor, and plays it for his baby sister [[Natalia Jedaleon]].  He plays beautiful, but refuses to learn another song on the harp other than this one.  Galad is drawn to his mother's garden inside of the castle, where he spends quiet solitude near a statue of her.  He is fiercely protective of the garden, and insists that he alone cares for it.  She was known for her green thumb as well as her generosity, and would freely distribute the exotic fruits to those most in need.  Galad continues this tradition in her loving memory.

Galad inherited the throne at a time of great sorrow and peril.  His father was murdered during an attack on the city of [[Deepwater]] by an ancient cult known as [[The Remnant]], where many perished.  He harbors a great hatred for [[The Remnant]], for [[Blood Magic]], and for atrocities against [[The Gods]].

!Expanding The Empire Further
In 1026 [[AAP]], as [[The Empire|The Viridian Empire]] was gripped by war from the [[Oathsworn]] led by [[Arman Blackbane]] in [[The Northlands]], Galad sent [[The Knights Of Deepwater]] to squash the rising rebellion.  As a growing [[Apotheon]], [[Arman Blackbane]] proved more difficult to squash.  Galad himself traveled to [[The Northlands]] to the city of [[Kohor]] where [[Arman Blackbane's|Arman Blackbane]] army had their foothold.  After an intense negotiation, the two parties agreed that any [[Kell]] that wished it could establish their own sovereign nation in the north east of [[The Viridian Empire]].  They would be considered an independent nation and always welcome in [[The Empire]].

Likewise, with the creation of [[The Theocracy]] by the [[Apotheon]] [[Staz Amrius Kafanz]], many [[Orcs|Orc]] of [[The Orcish Lands]] began to establish a civilized nation on the coast of [[The Orcish Lands]].  Seeking parlay with Galad, they agreed to join [[The Empire|The Viridian Empire]] in exchange for assistance in establishing their existence. </pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/galvandra/galvandra.jpg]]

Galvandra (5114 [[IO]] - ?), or &quot;watched petal&quot; in [[Elvish]], was a [[Draugaira]] [[Druid]] of [[The Third Age]] who mastered death itself.  Eschewing the teachings of [[Valouria]] and [[Lucian]], she began to consume [[the nature spirit|Faeratha]] inside of her in order to master death itself.  Once respected and revered, her journey began to take a dark and disturbing path.

!No Friend To Humans
Galvandra and her family lived peacefully and in harmony with nature, until the warlord [[Harmost Xawn]] and his army from [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]] destroyed her land, and captured and tortured her family to death.  She was made into a slave of [[The Oeriian Kingdoms]] and since that time, a burning hatred of [[Humanity|Human]] consumed her and sent her on the downward spiral that drove the rest of her existence.

!Mother Of Galvanic Practices
Intrigued by the [[mortal races|Races]], she began a quest to better understand the nature of the [[Soul]].  Eventually making contact with [[Ammenon]], she reluctantly joined him as she saw a means for him to further her work.  It is said that Galvandra was one of the few that [[Ammenon]] never gained power over - and was one of the few beings on [[Asha]] that he respected, admired, and even loved.  Galvandra did not share his feelings, instead using [[Ammenon]] as a tool to further her research.
She formed the basis of her theory on mortal life extension in what is now known as [[Galvanism]] through invasive study.  Her journals were extensive, with over 23 volumes concerning the machinery of the body.  The books themselves, written on [[Human]] skin were the result of experimentation in which she cut apart living men to watch their organs work.  This research on life is considered one of the most thorough ever done, and her surviving journals and knowledge comprise the backbone of the practices of [[The Medica]].
When [[The Whispered One's|The Whispered One]] reign ended, they found the bones of over 20,000 people in her laboratory alongside great pits of bones and ashes.

!The creation of Xawn
[[Harmost Xawn]] was one of the most powerful and fiercest warlords of [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]].  It was Galvandra who devised the rituals necessary to enslave his [[Soul]] forever, making him an obedient puppet to [[Ammenon]] as punishment for the countless atrocities he committed.  Galvandra and [[Ammenon]] saw to it that they exacted a revenge 100 fold on [[Harmost Xawn]].

!The Genocide Of The Duergar'Ran
[[The Whispered One]] forever changed the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] of the [[Duergar'Ran]], in an attempt to pacify them into more obedient slaves.  It was Galvandra's knowledge that allowed them to be genetically altered, such that their [[Soul]] could not [[Return To The Stone]] and continue to serve [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]] even in death.

!The Ascension Of The Whispered One
At [[Ammenon's|Ammenon]] chiding, Galvandra unlocked the rituals and techniques that would allow his frail [[Human]] body to undergo the ascension to [[Lichdom|Lich]].</pre>

Gargauth was the warlord of [[Avernus]], the first circle of [[Baator]] known as [[The Circle Of Pride|Avernus]] until he was supplanted by [[Shalekasha]].  He is a [[Dathairä]] skilled in betrayal and political corruption.  He resembles a crimson-scaled colossus with massive, bat-like wings, clawed extremities, and fangs that drip a green, smoking venom.

Calculating and calm, Gargauth is charming.  He is one of the greatest military minds in [[Baator]], using tactical advantage and only engaging in combat on his own terms.  His favored tactic involves ambushes, double-crosses, feints and counter-feints; backstabbing his enemies while anticipating the treacherous moves of his rivals.  While he is generally cool-headed, he can erupt into anger; especially when the topic of [[Shalekasha]] is broached.

He is prideful, greedy, and cruel.  Gargauth is a dangerous and thoroughly wicked being, the guise of civil compasion he wears at first only making the cruelty more horrible.  He comes off personable and charming, which is just a veneer for a being so utterly foul.  He has more self-control than most of his kind, and believes himself to be one of, if not the, smartest [[Dathairä]].  His self control lies in the fact that he also has a strong sense of humor; a trait lost to others of his race.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/genasi.jpg]]
Genasi are [[Planetouched]], able to trace their ancestry to the [[Seraph]] of [[The Fountains Of Creation]] or an ancestor who was mutated by one of those [[Elemental Planes|The Fountains Of Creation]].  Each Genasi can tap into the power of one of [[The Elemental Planes|The Fountains Of Creation]]: [[Air|The Elemental Plane Of Air]], [[Fire|The Elemental Plane Of Fire]], [[Water|The Elemental Plane Of Water]], and [[Earth|The Elemental Plane Of Earth]].  These are the four types of Genasi; some being a direct descendants of a [[Seraph]], others being born to non-Genasi parents who lied near a place suffused with elemental magic.

The Genasi are very rare to be encountered in [[Asha]], and are often more alien socially and in their outlook compared to the other [[Planetouched]] of other lineages.

!Air Genasi Traits
Air Genasi embody trains from [[The Elemental Plane Of Air]], and are able to draw upon a connection to the wind.  Their skin tones include many shades of blue, along with the full range of human skin tones, with bluish or ashen casts.  Sometimes their skin is marked by lines that seem like cracks with bluish white energy spilling out.  An Air Genasi's hair might blow in a phantom wind or be made entirely of clouds or vapor.

!Earth Genasi Traits
An Earth Genasi's skincan be the colors of stone and earth, or a [[Human]] skin tone with glittering sparkles like gem dust.  Some Earth Genasi have lines marking their skin like cracks, either showing glimmering gemlike veins or a dim, yellowish glow.

!Fire Genasi Traits
Nearly all Fire Genasi have a higher than typical internal core temperature, reinforced by flaming red, coal-black, or ash-gray skin tones.  The more [[Human]] looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme conditions.

!Water Genasi Traits
Most Water Genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair.  They smell of fresh rain and clean water.  Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color.

<pre>History and information about the realms can only be found in the small and pitiful archives kept by the [[Humans|Human]].  Unfortunately the libraries of the [[Humans|Human]] are very sparse concerning the creation and past of Asha, due to their race being so young.

!The Continent Of Kellos
The largest civilization on [[Asha]], [[The Viridian Empire]] is on the continent of [[Kellos]].  It is comprised of 9 regions: [[The Northlands]], [[The Green Sea]], [[The Stone Lands]], [[The Isles]], [[The Keep]], [[The Coast]], [[The Waste]], [[Orcish Lands]], and [[The Elvish Lands]].

Human maps are vague and often inaccurate concerning anything outside their major zone of control (which is an approximate 600 mile wide, 400 mile high landmass).  Modern day explorers find passage East past [[The Nenakessana River]] to be difficult.  These untamed lands are the battleground for the holy war between the [[Elves|Elf]] and the [[Orc]].  Even the most way of travelers often find themselves caught between the two warring factions.

Passage North is easier, how ever travel is slowed by thick lush forests with trees that appear to be as old as the land itself.   These mystical forests are rumored to be the resting place of [[The Sylvan Empire]], although explorers have never found any signs or clues (other than an eerie sense of being watched, which pierces the heart of even the strongest of will).

Passage South takes the traveler through [[Orcish lands]].  Colonization of these territories is a laughable undertaking at best, due to the hostility of the environment.  Large active volcanoes, stagnant marshes, and dense tropical jungles indicate how this wild land is still primordial in nature.

!The Continent Of Uskard
Uskard is ruled by [[The Nissido Dynasty]] and while once described as a bright and beautiful jewel is a suffering landscape due to the cataclysm that occurred here known as [[The Destruction Of Uskard]] in 29 [[IO]].  The event is known to the [[Uskardeen]] as &quot;The Mourning&quot;.

[[Tieflings|Tiefling]] are outlawed and detained; captured or killed by [[The Bezimen]]; soldiers loyal to [[The Dynasty|The Nissido Dynasty]].  [[The Bezimen]] are feared by the populace due to their strictness and lack of mercy.  They hide their faced behind golden masks.

Many who live in [[Uskard]] are followers of old and ancient traditions, including the religious movement known as [[The Way]], a philosophy focused on balance.  [[The Palace Of The Way]] in the city of [[Jakah]] is the oldest known temple in [[Asha]].

!The Continent Of Amon
The continent of [[Amon]] is landlocked to the continent of [[Ruje].  It is ruled by [[The Amoni Concord]], one of the largest and most powerful civilizations of [[Humans|Human]] in [[The Fourth Age]].  While at one time the [[Amonite]] people were expressionistic and poised at the primary seat of power in world politics, [[The Amoni Concord]] has become a more loose collective government focused more on inward concerns.

The [[Amoni]] culture is a proud culture, where the [[Amonite]] people are not only familiar with, but boast of their history.  Notable scholars and powerful generals who have shaped the understanding of the world and the [[Cosmos|The Planes Of Existence]].

!The Continent Of Ruje
Covered in a dense impenetrable jungle known as [[The Sorrow]], and plagued with [[Magical|Magic]] storms known as [[Highstorms|Highstorm]], [[Ruje]] is an isolated and savage location.  The land is full of dangerous creatures and undiscovered riches.

On the eastern edge of the continent is an island chain known as [[The Crescent]] where the only 8 cities exist that represent the civilized world in these parts.  These cities have formed an alliance known as [[The Hegemony]], bound together by their isolation from the broader outside world.

!The Floating Islands Of Caldoria
Raised from the bottom of the sea, the islands of [[Caldoria]] float in the air propelled by [[Magic]].  The denizens of this mysterious island chain are comprised mainly of [[Dragonborn]] and [[Tabaxi]].  As the islands were submerged beneath the ocean for countless millennia, the flora and fauna and culture of [[Caldoria]] is unique and alien to the remainder of [[Asha]].

Gerkyl Jadebraid (701 [[AAP]] - Current) is the [[Dwarf]] proprietor of [[The Short Gentleman]], an inn within the city of [[Candlekeep]] on the continent of [[Amon]].  He is a kind looking [[Dwarf]] with rosy cheeks and a fluffy white beard.  He wears spectacles on the brim of his nose, and can not see very well without them.  Gerkyl is proud of his establishment, despite it not being the most clean and fancy and well appointed.  He treats all customers as [[Patriar]].  He is constantly busy, however it is unclear what he is doing for [[The Short Gentleman]] isn't the cleanest inn.
It is known that he has a soft spot for children, for he himself never had a childhood.

!The Short Gentleman
Gerkyl was born in [[Kellos]], and migrated to [[Amon]] when he was a child.  He and his family moved from city to city and stayed in plenty of inns.  It was here that Gerkyl determined to make an inn that would make people feel like home; the home he never had.  He works [[The Short Gentleman]] alone, and struggles to keep it tidy.  It is poorly furnished, but cozy.

!The Gentleman's Drink
Gerkyl is a skilled brewer of beer and spirits, and for [[Panathenaea]] he makes a special spiced beer known as [[The Gentleman's Drink]].  The specific ingredients are a closely guarded secret, and the townsfolk flock to the inn to partake.  This pleases Gerkyl beyond his wildest dreams, for the inn is often quiet during those months.</pre>

Gloomglow is a crystalline mineral found within [[The Shadowfell]].  Typically, Gloomglow forms in crystalline bunches that are no longer than a finger - however, the [[Kenku]] have mastered the secret of farming clusters as high as five feet tall.  It is cultivated by the [[Kenku]] and tithed to [[The Raven Queen]].

Shadow creatures, such as [[The Gloomstalker]] and [[Barguul]] are repelled by Gloomglow, however it is unknown exactly as to why.  However still, Gloomglow is placed in important locations as a defense and protection.  The crystal also has the property of staving off the corruption of the [[Soul]] which causes creatures who stay too long within [[The Shadowfell]] to turn into shadow.

Gorgothuun was a [[Dragon]] who lived during [[The Third Age]].  Some sages have said that he ruled over a large swathe of land in modern day [[Ruje]] in a time before the land become civilized by [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]].  He had multiple lairs at the time; scattered across the region.

It was the [[Human]] [[Ammenon]] who subdued Gorgothuun; at the time an Ancient Green [[Dragon]] using [[Blood Magic]].  [[Ammenon]] struck a bargain with Gorgothuun, promising everlasting life for assistance in conquering the continent.  Together they decimated the population of [[Draugaira]] [[Elves|Elf]], using this act to cement their immortality.

Gorgothuun is cruel, ruthless, and intelligent.  He closely guards his [[Phylactery]], which prevents his [[Soul]] from moving on; granting him the ability to live forever.  A master of both [[Draconic Sorcery|Draconic Bloodline]] and [[Blood Magic]], Gorgothuun is a formidable fighter.

A grave flower is a perennial woody flower named for how it grows predominantly near graveyards and cemeteries.  It has a dark purple hue, with a soft interior that has a faint glow of violet.  It is a symbol of rebirth and immortality, as life grows from those who have departed.  The flower is thought of with respect and fondness, with the belief that a piece of one's [[Soul]] may be preserved within the magic of the flower.  The magic of the flower makes it a component of spirit based [[Blood Magic]].

A Grave Flower is created when a [[Soul]] in [[Elysium]] longs for a loved one that remains on [[The Material Plane]].  They are created from [[Elysian Roses|Elysian Rose]], and made from pure love.</pre>

!Natural Architecture And Design
Greenbough Keep is a marvel of [[Fey|The Feywild]] architecture, designed to merge seamlessly with the natural environment. The keep is built into the side of a towering, ancient [[Songspire Tree]], its walls formed from living wood that pulses with the life force of the tree itself.

It is a day of charity, where individuals hand out flowers and words of praise and thanks.

It is common for villages to celebrate by having a festival where those that are unmarried participate in a [[The Flower Dance]].

Gretchen Jamarion is the wife of [[Santino Jamarion]]. While he runs the house for [[The Grey Companions]], she runs the kitchens. She is an excellent cook, and is famous for her stew.

She has a perfect memory, and can remember anything she concentrates on (which is mostly cooking).  She is constantly nagging [[Santino Jamarion]], as she can always remember everything he has done wrong.  He has learned to just accept it and move on.

Gretchen possesses a bravery that borders on foolhardy.  She speaks her mind, and is not afraid of confrontation.  Gretchen has a peculiar way of working food analogies into normal conversation.  She has been known to describe people as onions, broth, or dumplings.  Many years ago, [[Santino Jamarion]] was aghast when Gretchen referred to a visiting noble as &quot;Lord Noodle&quot;, because he was so spineless and slippery (and she just didn't like the look of him).

It takes awhile for Gretchen to warm up to new people, and she has a general suspicion when she first meets them.  Her husband is wise to this, and ensures she stays in the kitchen when visitors arrive.  However she sneaks sideways glances at them to ensure they aren't up to no good.  She doesn't dislike new people, only wants to ensure they don't cause any mischief.  Once she gets to know them, Gretchen is a loyal friend and companion - and treats her closest compatriots like family.

It is difficult to find someone who takes more pride in being a member of [[The Viridian Empire]] than Gretchen.  She is fanatic in her support for the [[Emperor]], and claims her family tree intersects with [[House Jedaleon]] in a very distant bloodline, even though there is no evidence.  [[Santino Jamarion]] hates this story, and dismisses it as blabber.</pre>

!Description
The isle of Grimstone within [[The Risen Reef]] off of the coast of [[Amon]] is home to [[The Mummers]], a pirate organization led by [[The Salt King]].  Over two centuries ago in 785 [[AAP]], Grimstone was claimed by [[The Mummers]] as a safe haven due to the shallow reefs that make getting there perilous.
[[The Mummers]] are a loose union of pirates and criminals who amass their wealth through cunning, intimidation, and cleverness.  [[The Salt King]] keeps the order on the island, which is surprisingly crime free.  It is kept this way through harsh punishments dealt to those who cause trouble and don't abide by the few laws found there.
Of all of the islands within [[The Jade Sea]], none is the equal of Grimstone.  Dangerous, boisterous, drunken and bawdy, it is a pirate heaven.  Named after how the caves within the cliff face resemble a skull from the right angle.

The people of [[Ruje]] are shrouded in mystery to the remainder of [[Asha]] due to the difficulty of travel in the region.  Teleportation into [[Ruje]] is thought to be impossible due to the prevalence of [[Highstorms|Highstorm]] which sap [[Magic]] from permanent [[Enchantment]], and travel by ship is equally dangerous due to the savage predators and frequent storms.  What little is known about the Rujevian people trickles out through limited trade with [[Amon]]. 

!Physical Attributes
The Rujevian typically have dark hair, but their body types, skin tones and eye colors vary greatly, as &quot;Rujevian&quot; is in fact a general term describing several ethnicities that live in the area. They are ruled by the immortal [[Aurum]], who they place in high regard; almost a religious significance.  Both men and women of nobility tend to wear their hair long and in a topknot.  Flowing robes of silk are in fashion.

!Beliefs and Spirituality
* [[The Order of 10,000 Gods]] - is an ancient [[Religion]] that worships an entity that lives upon the mainland of [[Ruje]] known as [[The Liminal]].  They believe the creature holds the power to restore the splendor of [[The First Age]].
* [[The Cult Of Aroden]] - [[Aroden]] was a [[Rujevian]] who rose to become an [[Apotheon]].  Prior to his ascension he solidified a religious fervor among a small number of people who have formed a religion.  They call themselves [[The Stormborn]].

!Currency
* The lowest denomination is known as an [[Iron Shim]], followed by an [[Iron Dinar]] and then a [[Gold Dragon]].
* Occasionally [[Electrum]] coins from [[Amon]] make it into circulation, but they have even lesser value in [[Ruje]], as does Copper coinage as Copper is thought to be a metal in [[Ruje]] best left to sheathing roofs and pipes.

!Language
* The language spoken most commonly in the region is [[Atlian]].</pre>

Younger members of the race may have been born after [[The Third Desecration]] and only know life of tribal existence.  [[Variona'Sha]] often have the serious, stern, and focused demeanor of a soldier.  Those who learn to channel [[Primal Magic]] become a [[Variona'Sha Shaman]] and are [[Druids|Druid]] at the spiritual center of the [[clan|Variona'Sha Clans]].

* a common means of implying forever, or a long passage of time is &quot;Until the stones forget&quot;
* a dismissive phrase is &quot;listen to my laughter&quot;, and &quot;much wind pours from your mouth&quot;

!Suggested Characteristics

Welcome to [[The Amoni Concord]], the land of the [[Amonites|Amonite]], a proud and disciplined people with one of the oldest cultures of [[The Fourth Age]].  The original [[Amoni Empire|The Amoni Empire]] stretched across all known continents before it collapsed under its own weight, and the [[Amoni]] culture underpins much of modern society (something an [[Amonite]] is often proud of reminding everyone of).  Even [[The Common Tongue]] is a language based upon [[Amoni]].  As an [[Amonite]], you are a member of a society that values strength, discipline, and order above all else.  In this guide, we will explore the various aspects of [[Amoni]] culture and how to roleplay an [[Amonite]] character with authenticity.

While the people of [[Amon]] are known as [[Amonites|Amonite]], objects and things are described as [[Amoni]].  [[Amonites|Amonite]] are offended at being called [[Amoni]]. 

!Appearance
As an [[Amonite]], your appearance is characterized by a well-groomed and clean-shaven look, with short hair being the norm for men. Clothing is simple yet elegant, with the signature piece being the [[Alba]], a length of cloth draped over the shoulders and wrapped around the body, similar to a Toga. Sandals with cloth or leather straps complete the outfit. You take pride in your appearance and always present yourself in a dignified and respectable manner.  The [[Alba]] is favored by both genders.

!Politics / Government
The [[Amonites|Amonite]] are a highly disciplined and organized people, with a hierarchical social structure that is based on merit and achievement.  The government of [[Amon]] is known as [[The Amoni Concord]], divided into six regions known as [[Polités|Polité]] (pronounced {{{POLE-IT-AY}}}).  each region ruled by a [[Tribune]], elected by the [[Patriar]]: an elite class of the incredibly wealthy, who assist in governing and setting laws.

It is expected that the [[Amonite]] always conduct themselves with discipline and respect, upholding the laws and traditions of [[The Concordia|The Amoni Concord]].  They value order and hierarchy and seek to maintain it at all times.  The [[Amonite]] believe one should always act with honor and integrity and hold themselves to a high standard of behavior.

!Food
The signature dish of [[Amon]] is a thin floury waffle known as a [[Blabeta]] (pronounced {{{BLAH-BAY-TAH}}}), it is either hard or soft depending on the sides and topping it is served with.  Street vendors can be found selling them as handheld snacks with either sweet fruit or savory seafood.

!Naming
Many [[Amonite]] take pride in their names, of which each [[Amonite]] has three representing both personal and family heritage: a praenomen, nomen and cogomen.  The Prenomen is a true personal name, chosen by a child's parents and bestowed on the tenth day after their birth.  A nomen or &quot;gentle name&quot; was an acknowledgement of the family or clan.  Each member of the extended family shared the same nomen.  The cognomen was third and optional element of one's name, being bestowed to distinguish personal characteristics, habits, occupations, places of origina, heroic exploits, and so forth.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/kellos/the-northlands/gydas-addonia.jpg]]
Gydas Addonia was a legendary ruler of [[The First Men]] during [[The Second Age]] on the continent of what is currently called [[Kellos]].  According to [[Kellish|Kell]] tales and stories (such as [[The Poem Of The Myrthmaker]]), he was instrumental in [[Human]] survival during this chaotic time; allowing his clan to survive attacks from [[Jötnar]] and [[Dragons|Dragon]] when civilization was near collapse.  The details of his life are lost to time, and are pieced together by fragments of poems, song, and folklore.

!The Warrior
Gydas was a fierce warrior and champion of [[The FIrst Men]].  He carved a home inside of the chaos that was the aftermath of [[The First Desecration]].  When [[Humanity|Human]] was on the brink of extinction, he was responsible for its survival.  Life during this time was a constant battle and struggle, and forces were unleashed upon [[Asha]] that sought to devour it all.  Once the dust began to settle, he saw hope in the future; a vision of enlightenment.  He connected with [[Asha]], and understood his fate.

!The Myrthmaker
He gave away all of his wordily possessions to those in need, living off of [[Asha]] itself.  Gydas had a soft spot for the children, who he saw as the future of mankind.  They would know a time without struggle, without hardship; a peaceful existence.

!Tall Tales
The number of stories of his superhuman exploits are many.  All center around his famous axe that he named [[Dagda]] that was said to be forged from a meteor by [[Jötnar]].  The axe was too heavy and large for a normal man, but Gydas was strong of body and large of size.  He also was said to to have found a harp made of living oak that he named [[Xala]] on the [[Winterscrest]] on which he gave away his possessions.  He was close companions with many spirits, one with nature, and friend of [[Asha]]; upon his death it was said [[Asha]] honored him with immortality, allowing his spirit to walk [[Asha]] forever.

!Winterscrest
It is believed that on Winterscrest, Gydas's spirit walks [[Asha]].  He leaves gifts and trinkets to those in most need of them.  While the [[Kell]] erect statues in his honor, others celebrate by keeping a tree safe through a harsh winter.</pre>

Haamnaa Srozzen, known also as [[The Sundering Shadow]], is an [[Oni]] who controls [[The Nissido Dynasty]] of [[Uskard]].  He was created/awakened in the events leading up to [[The Destruction Of Uskard]] in 29 [[IO]] as a secret research and development undertaking by [[The Cowled Wizards]], who sought to create and design the ultimate [[Uskardeen]] by combing the tombs of the greatest leaders in history and using their long-dead genetic blueprints to produce a being with the genius, the ruthlessness, the daring, and the shrewdness of past [[Uskardeen]] leaders.  Haamnaa Srozzen is a brillant tactician and a master of political intrigue, and it was he who secretly brought upon the events that lead to [[The Destruction Of Uskard]].

The people of [[Uskard]] who comprise [[The Nissido Dynasty]] are unaware of Haamnaa Srozzen's identity as an [[Oni]].  Leading from the shadows, he instead takes on the guise of a long genetic dynasty. 

!The Apotheons Attempt To Unseat Him
In 1026 [[AAP]] the [[Apotheon]] [[Aereon Zara Al-Wali]] attempted to kill the [[Oni]] but failed.  While Haamnaa Srozzen did significantly lose power from her unexpected and unforeseen strike against him, he ultimately survived in a weakened state.  He has developed an intense hatred for her.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/fey/fairfolk/hag.jpg]]
!Origins
Hags originate from [[The Feywild]], originally members of [[The Court Of Stars]] in service to [[SenaCethu]].  They were beautiful and powerful, respected and adored due to their mastery of all [[Magic]].  [[SenaCethu]] directed them to tamper with dark primal forces for [[The Court|The Court Of Stars]], spying on other [[Archfey]] and toying with mortals.  When [[The Court Of Stars]] was eradicated, the Hags were banished from [[The Feywild]] for their deeds and their memories of [[The Court Of Stars]] removed.  The [[Archfey]] spared their lives out of pity; as they were as much victims of [[SenaCethu's|SenaCethu]] charm.  Memories lost, they scattered across [[The Planes Of Existence]], finding refuge in remote places where they could practice their [[Magic]] in solitude.  Their Fey ancestry grants them immortality, and they are fascinated by mortals.

!Faces Of Evil
While born beautiful, their outer selves became a mirror of their inner beauty the longer they were detached from [[The Feywild]].  They became warped reflections of their former selves.  Hideous inside and out, taking the forms of unsightly old women.  They have withered faces, frayed hair, and are covered in horrid moles and warts.  Their simple clothes are always tattered and filthy, covering their often hunched frame and overly long limbs.  While rare, there are a very small number of male Hags.  They are physical creations from [[The Quicksilver Program]], an ancient initiative once created by [[SenaCethu]] to create a [[Feytouched]] child which he named [[Naurase]].  While he is long gone, the Hags continue with the desire to create an [[Archfey]] to lead them once again into [[The Feywild]].  Most male children are destroyed at birth by the Hags as they are too bloodthirsty and aggressive.

!Covens
Hags are solitary and selfish creatures, but in times of necessity will group together in [[Covens|Hag Coven]].  They consider themselves sisters, granting the Hags within the [[Coven|Hag Coven]] access to more powerful [[Magic]].  A [[Coven|Hag Coven]] consists of three Hags so that any arguments between two can be settled by the third.  Any attempt for a larger coven always ends in chaos.

!A Foul Nature
Hags are unpredictable, vain, and greedy; however easily shift to a grandmotherly personality when dealing with creatures they feel are much less powerful than them.  Hags love the macabre and cover themselves with dead things and accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth.  They are hoarders of what they consider unique and rare, and are fascinated by death and [[Souls|Soul]].  Disrespecting a Hag is deadly, as a more monstrous personality comes forth and they see your life as forfeit.  A Hag always fulfills their end of a bargain, and have means to lock in bargains using [[Magic]].

!Dark Bargains and Ancient Codes of Conduct
A Hag follows an ancient and strict code of conduct that hints at their Fey origins.  It forbids them from openly fighting each other, and commits them to honoring deals and bargains they make.  A Hag does not believe in taking by force or theft - they enjoy deals and bargains, and believe everything has a price.  A Hag holds hospitality in great regard, and wishes for visitors to feel welcome and relaxed, as a visitor at ease is easier to beguile.  It is custom for visitors to bring gifts, and a Hag will always bring something when traveling to another domain.  Gifts must be subtle and not openly given as gifts, but simply a token a friendship and gratitude.
Outside of [[The Feywild]], they prey on those who seek after their wisdom; using one's greed and vanity against them.  A Hag places value on aspects of one's character, personality, or [[Soul]]; trading them in return for boons and favors.  Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that a Hag's rules of conduct apply to all creatures.  When confronted by such an individual, a Hag might find it amusing to string the fool along for a while before teaching it a permanent lesson.

!Monstrous Motherhood
A Hag does not reproduce, but can create a new Hag by corrupting a mortal [[Human]] baby.  Not all children are capable of becoming a Hag, as they must possess a corruptible heart.  After stealing a [[Human]] baby from its cradle or its mother's womb, the Hag consumes the poor child.  A week later, the Hag gives birth to a daughter who looks [[Human]] until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the Hag performs a dark ritual to transform the child into a Hag.  Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating [[Covens|Hag Coven]].  A Hag might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.

!Dark Lairs
Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed seacoasts and gloomy swamps.  These dark places give the Hag power to fuel their dark [[Magic]].</pre>

<pre>The town of Hagen has been the seat of power for [[House Carrington]] for generations.  It is a smaller, isolated city with dense forests and mountains making passage all but impossible except for the single road leading into the city.  in 1003 [[AAP]] during [[The Siege Of Derby]], [[House Blackbriar]] used the chaos to murder [[House Carrington]] and blame the deed on [[House Conlon]].  Being a [[Vampire]], [[Martin Blackbriar]] brought death and darkness to [[Hagen]] and the surrounding area.  The townsfolk were all but imprisoned as [[Blackbriar's|Martin Blackbriar]] power grew and a magical fog surrounded them and acted as a barrier they could not break through.  [[Martin Blackbriar]] is no more, but the evil he committed here still lingers.  The 18 years in which he grew in power sapped life and hope from the people of Hagen.  Though homes have been rebuilt and undead monstrosities have been eradicated, the trauma of his reign will be carrier by the people for generations.  It was [[The Grey Companions]] who liberated the town in 1021 [[AAP]].

Limited in fertile farm land, locally grown produce is scarce - keeping the size of the town small.  Castle Hagen is an ancient structure erected not long after the town's founding - and has been the noble seat of [[House Carrington]] until their fall.  The interior has a regal starkness to it, while the hunting trophies and tapestries that decorate the walls are clear signs of wealth, there is a solumn, beautiful hollowness to its corridors.  [[Frederick Carrington]], who now holds control of the city claims the walls carry the melancholy of [[House Carrington]], and the sorrow for witnessing the [[Blackbriar's|House Blackbriar]] evil.

Veins of [[Cavorite]] are found in the area, which when distilled with acids form into a material known as [[Residuum]] that is susceptible to [[Enchantment]].

<div title="Hamit Kartal" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202207312124" modified="202212021506" tags="person" changecount="26">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/amon/hamit-kartal.jpg]]

Hamit Kartal (979 [[AAP]] - Current) is the captain of [[The Amberwitch]], and a pirate of [[The Mummers]] with a dark past who operate within [[The Risen Reef]] off of the coast of [[Amon]].  He has willingly given his [[Soul]] to [[The Ferryman]], and as such is respected but shunned by his former [[Mummers|The Mummers]].  He struggles to keep a crew for any length of time, as many sailors can not trust one without a [[Soul]].  He has dirty blonde hair which hangs in long locks over his face, and is considered a handsome man.  But don't let his good looks fool you, for he is a rough man with a rougher past.

!The Death Of Garrad The Wise
[[Garrad Stroud]] was [[The Salt King]] of [[The Mummers]], and beloved by Hamit who saw him as a grand-father figure.  Under [[Garrad Stroud]], Hamit excelled as a gentlemen pirate - with chivalrous rules and conduct.  He saw piracy as a creative dance of predator and prey.  In 1006 [[AAP]], [[Garrad Stroud]] was murdered by [[Caxton Loom]], a beast of a man and a terrible [[Salt King|The Salt King]].  Hamit was not only devastated that he lost a beloved leader, but also aghast that [[Caxton Loom]] sought to remove [[The Code Of The Mummers|The Mummers]] which Hamit cherished dearly. 
At this time, Hamit was the captain of [[The Black Rose]], and a prominent up and coming captain within [[The Mummers]].  His first mate was [[Tasarla Drace]], a young waif of a girl who was the daughter of a prominent [[Patriar]] family.  It was Hamit who whisked her away with his charm and taste of adventure.  He joined forces with a small outspoken group of captains who railed against [[Caxton Loom]] and his heavy handed view of the future of [[The Mummers]].  One in particular was the most outspoken, [[Rafail Kallides]].  [[Rafail|Rafail Kallides]] was willing to beat [[Caxton Loom]] by any means necessary, regardless of the cost.

!The Sinking Of The Black Rose
In a fierce final battle between ships loyal to [[Caxton Loom]] and those rebelling against, Hamit and the crew of [[The Black Rose]] found themselves on the losing side.  Vastly outnumbered, Hamit and the other captains realized it was only a matter of time before all was lost to the sea.  Taking a ramming blow to her hull, [[The Black Rose]] was taking on water and moments from sinking.  Spurred by [[Rafail's|Rafail Kallides]] conviction that winning was worth any cost, Hamit Kartal did what would have been unthinkable: he made a deal with [[The Ferryman]].
After Hamit willingly gave his [[Soul]], a storm came from nowhere and caused the vessels loyal to [[Caxton Loom]] to receive an unfavorable position in the combat.  The other captains, including [[Rafail Kallides]] made short work of the crew and captured [[The Salt King]].  Many where aghast and confused at Hamit's choice, as most saw him as the obvious choice for [[The New Salt King|The Salt King]] of [[The Mummers]].  One who would bring dignity back to the organization.  With a forfeit [[Soul]] to [[The Ferryman]] that could be collected at any time, the title of [[The Salt King]] passed to [[Rafail Kallides]].

!The Blood Curse
Hamit Kartal lives knowing that [[The Ferryman]] may collect his prize at any time.  Since his deal, Hamit has delved deeper into [[Blood Magic]].  The heavy burden and cost of the [[Blood Magic]] rituals that at one time repulsed him no longer seeming meaningful knowing that his [[Soul]] was forfeit.
His left hand is dark black, having completed a ritual that allows him to remove it and for it to act on its own accord.  He draws power from a [[Lindworm]] egg among other trinkets that he uses to explore the edges of his deal with [[The Ferryman]] in a potentially futile undertaking to once again claim ownership of his lost [[Soul]].  He retains his pleasant demeanor, and distances himself from the typical trappings of one who studies [[Blood Magic]]; for he is still aghast and wracked with guilt when he finds himself using it.

!Days Of Adventuring
Soon after his deal with [[The Ferryman]], Hamit sought to distance himself from [[The Mummers]] and fate found him adventuring with a young [[Wizard|Wizardry]] named [[Artimas Meliger]].</pre>

Harmost Xawn was one of the most powerful and fiercest warlords of [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]] during [[The Third Age]].  He was a powerful warrior and a cunning tactician that earned him the respect of even his rivals.  As [[Ammenon's|Ammenon]] armies swept across the land crushing the territories of the other warlords, Xawn was able to hold his nation's ground through successive brilliant tactical maneuvers and battle prowess.

Xawn's army was a match for [[Ammenon's|Ammenon]], and for years Xawn harried the growing undead army that [[Ammenon]] commanded.  Xawn no longer held his ground, but began to win battle after battle against armies that dwarfed his in size.  The loses grated on [[Ammenon]], who wished to see the continent fully subjugated until his rule.

In the end, [[Ammenon]] himself took to the field personally to see too Harmost Xawn's defeat.  In an epic battle, Xawn was bested but in a rare act of mercy ordered by [[Ammenon]] to be spared.  He forced Xawn to watch as his army, tired and beaten were slaughtered like animals and the heads of his soldiers arrayed in a pile before him; including his two sons who acted as his field lieutenants.  His will broken, [[Ammenon]] used [[Blood Magic]] to corrupt Xawn's mind into a faithful bodyguard, servant and slave to his will.  Xawn became a shell of his former self; no longer fully of this world.</pre>

A Hearttree (also known as a Mother Tree) is a species of deciduous tree found within [[The Elvish Lands]].  The five-pointed leaves and the sap of the Hearttree is blood-red, while the smooth bark on their wide trunks and wood are bone white.  These trees live forever if undisturbed, rooting deep into the ground.  The health of the surrounding ecosystem becomes attuned and symbiotic to the health of the Hearttree.

!Religious Significance
The [[Elves|Elf]] consider the Hearttree sacred, seeing them as connections to [[The Mother|Valouria]].  The trees are used to bear witness to important ceremonies such as marriages and oaths.  The [[Draugaira]] [[Elves|Elf]], having had all of the Hearttree's within [[Amon]] burned by [[The Whispered One]] instead have a custom of placing an [[enchanted|Enchantment]] [[Reliquary]] at the center of their cities.

!Propagation
Once every 1,000 years a Hearttree will produce a single fruit in the form of a hard seed.  This nut can be safely stored and cared for; once planted it takes 5-15 years to mature.</pre>

<div title="Hermokrates Ernandosoro" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202301151925" modified="202307051128" tags="person" changecount="13">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/hermokrates-ernandosoro.jpg]]
Hermokrates Ernandosoro (978 [[AAP]] - Current) is the [[Scion]] of [[The Lower Streap]] of the city of [[Tszanthus]].  Preferring to be called &quot;Herman&quot;, he is a large, rotund man with a jolly disposition, and is well-liked by the people of [[The Lower Streap]].  However, despite his good nature, he is oblivious to the criminal activity that takes place within the district and is seen as naive by the criminal element.  Known for his kindness and generosity, he is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need; and occasionally mistakes hardened criminals for destitute citizens down on their luck.

!The Scion Of The Lower Streap
The position of [[Scion]] is often a prestigious one, coveted by the rich and powerful.  [[The Lower Streap]], however is the roughest part of [[Tszanthus]]; the seedy underbelly full of cutthroats and criminals.  Prior to Hermokrates, the position was never filled for longer than a year (often ended with the death of the [[Scion]]) by the very criminal element that they watched over.  Being dull and dimwitted, Hermokrates sees [[The Lower Streap]] with rosy colored glasses.  Where others see squalor, he sees a people who need an opportunity.  Criminals are businessmen just trying to squeeze out a living in a harsh city.  The people of the [[Streap|The Lower Streap]] adore the big buffoon and his positive attitude, making him one of the first [[Scions|Scion]] of the district to be able to walk the streets without any harm being done to them.  The underworld enjoys him as [[Scion]], as they do not need to bribe him; only keep up the ruse that they are humble merchants.

!A Big Soft Heart
On his first day as [[Scion]], Hermokrates walked the streets of [[The Lower Streap]], despite protests against it, for his own safety.  He came across a group of rough-looking individuals loitering near the docks.  Despite their appearance and menacing demeanor, Hermokrates was not intimidated, and approached with a kind and generous smile; offering them help.  Actually being hardened criminals, they used the opportunity to exploit the wealthy [[Scion]], playing along and taking his offered coin.  This became a common occurrence and tales abound of him pardoning petty thieves who he felt were just trying to make ends meet, and even once helping unload heavy contraband from a ship in the docks when he noticed the criminals lifting with their backs instead of their legs.

His heart is large, and it is most clear when it comes to tax collection.  Hermokrates is known to waive tax fees for those less fortunate, which include nearly anyone within [[The Lower Streap]] who bothers to ask him for a reprieve.  What taxes he does not collect, he pays for out of his own pocket.  His only desire is the betterment of the community.  The other [[Scions|Scion]] see him as weak, as they use their position to advance themselves and their own agendas.  When challenged by others on why he cares for the people of [[The Lower Streap]], he is jovial and laughs off any concerns with the statement that they will likely pay him back later.

!His Friends Call Him Herman
Hermokrates is quick to make friends, even with those who may not reciprocate.  He insists all call him &quot;Herman&quot;, as he dislikes the formality people have with him due to his station.  He likes to think of himself as a &quot;man of the people&quot;, who cares for the plight of the &quot;common man&quot;.  Unfortunately, due in large part to his generosity, he can be at times ineffective at meeting the financial goals imposed by [[The Grand Scion]].  When this occurs, members of the organized crime families go out of their way to help him - as they know that their position is secured with Herman in charge as [[Scion]].

!The Unlikely Heir Of The Ernandosoro Wealth
His wealth was recently inherited from the death of his older brother [[Orfeo Ernandosoro]], who died of mysterious causes as the previous [[Scion]] of [[The Lower Streap]].  Herman, being the youngest of 12 siblings was the most unexpected heir of the Ernadosoro fortune; however all of the other brothers and sisters stepped aside as they knew full well that they would be left as [[Scion]] of [[The Lower Streap]], what they considered to be a death sentence.

!Hero Of The Lower Streap
Hermokrates' innocence and generosity has endeared him not only to the townsfolk of [[The Lower Streap]], but also the criminal element.  Violent crime has seen a sharp decrease, as even the criminals hold a sense of community greater than ever before.  Despite his lack of knowledge of their true intentions, criminal gangs have taken it upon himself to ensure Hermokrates remains in power as [[Scion]].  What once once a position threatened by criminals, it was now protected.  The gangs have even assisted him in filling the district's coffers to meet the tax quota one year when Hermokrates was short a few hundred [[Marks|Mark]].</pre>

A Highstorm is a fierce weather system that traverses the continent of [[Ruje]], staying mainly over the ocean of [[The Moonsea]].  A Highstorm can last for hours, and the brutality of these storms has shaped much of the ecosystem of the continent.  They are infused with [[Arcane]] energy, and can strip the [[Enchantment]] from objects over time.  Being exposed to a Highstorm for extended periods of time can deteriorate the mind and cause [[Tempestas Delirium]].

In the days leading up to a Highstorm, the region is blanketed by a fog that rolls in off of [[The Moonsea]].  This fog is known as [[The Veil]], because like a beautiful woman it is both mysterious and deadly.  It is a time when all good merchants keep close what is theirs, knowing that if they do not it will disappear int [[The Veil]].  [[The Veil]] is a warning of an approaching Highstorm, and all sane individuals heed that warning and seek shelter.

!The Tempestas Delirium
Those afflicted with [[Tempestas Delirium]] lose their mind and are troubled with heightened senses in which their perception is significantly altered.  They see phantoms that are not there, and live a life of psychotic episodes.  These episodes become more prominent and violent as a Highstorm approaches.</pre>

!Concerning The History Of Asha
From the dawn of the universe to the current [[Age|The Fourth Age]], the history of [[Asha]] is rich and full of wonders.  Much of the history of the universe is lost to time or is a many jumbled misunderstanding of the myths passed down through oral traditions, or religious writings that favor a particular teaching and theology.  The details are often debated, and while most plod forward living their entire lives without little care as to how [[Asha]] was created, there exist those who are hungry for purpose and willing to explore the dangerous unknowns where secrets may yet still lie.

!The Beginning
In a time before time, primordial forces known today as [[The Elder Gods]] began to take shape into a universe that was new and formless.  They cared only for their own existence; consuming, expanding, and thriving.  One of these entities, known as [[Umwe]], created [[his children|The Gods]] which would later become [[The Gods]] of [[Asha]].  After a great struggle with [[Azarad-Ji]], [[Asha]] was created as a final resting place for [[Valouria]], and [[The Gods]] imprisoned [[Azarad-Ji]] where he could do no harm.  In doing so, they created [[The Eternal Cycle]] which acted as an impenetrable veil that sealed [[Asha]] away from from the direct influences of [[The Elder Gods]].  Sadly, this carried with it a self-imposed sentence of exile - they would henceforth never be allowed to directly visit [[Valouria]].  [[Asha]] would forever be the realm for mortals. 

!The Origins Of Life
[[Asha]] was soon verdant and flowing with life, sprung from what final spark was left inside of [[Valouria]].  [[The Gods]] watched with wonder at the marvels of beauty found on the surface.  Over the eons, life continued to form and change; and it was to their surprise when they witnessed the first [[Humans|Human]] to take their first steps upon the surface of [[Asha]].  These creatures were capable of creating magnificent works and began to seize their place on the planet.

!Ages
In [[The Eternal Cycle]], Ages come and go.  Life struggles to retain its delicate foothold, only to then blossom into a precious understanding of itself.  Like a moth to a flame, life longs to understand its creator; only to undo themselves with the knowledge they seek.  Again and again, [[The Eternal Cycle]] repeats, and new Ages are born - each with Life rending itself with its own hubris.  Memories of past Ages fade into story and dust, allowing this dark history to repeat as Life fails to learn its most important lesson.  Yet time is eternal, and in the Fourth Age, an Age yet to come and an Age long past, a new hope arises.  The hope was not the beginning, there are neither beginnings nor endings to [[The Eternal Cycle]].  But it was a beginning.  Sages separate the history of the universe into[Ages, each a fascinating period of history marked with an abrupt end known as a [[Desecration]].

After [[The Gods]] were victories once again, they left their children [[The Dwarves|Dwarf]] and [[The Elves|Elf]] to care for their precious [[Asha]].  [[The Gods]] then self-exiled themselves, closing [[The Divine Gate]] to ensure [[Azarad-Ji]] would never be freed again.|

Hooper's Dreamland was a circus in [[The Summerset Isles]] started by [[Hooper Berengar]], a con-man and swindler.  He used the circus as a cover to steal from noble and well-off audience members.  The troupe was made up of many that claimed powers and abilities that didn't exist; yet for a brief time [[Penelope Kensington]] joined the group and turned it upside down.  She had true power that was able to see the future, sense trouble, and predict local events - [[Hooper Berengar]] took notice of the crowds she drew.

!Background
The crest of House Carrington is a Lion reared up on its hind legs.  The House could trace its lineage back to [[Tarmon Gellius]] himself.  The majority of the house was eradicated through a treacherous murder plot conducted by [[House Blackbriar]], to place full blame on [[House Conlon]] for the [[The Siege Of Derby]].  [[Lord]] [[Martin Blackbriar]] brought assassins to the village of [[Hagen]], the seat of the Carrington's power - and proceeded to murder the family after getting [[Lord]] [[Gregor Carrington]] to write a letter declaring [[House Conlon]] traitors.

[[Minerva Carrington]] was born the night of the treachery, and rescued by one of the assassins named [[Eaton]] who ran away and raised her as his own.

!Background
House Karbold is one of the [[Houses Of The Viridian Empire]].  They rule over [[The Northlands]] of [[Kellos]], their seat the city of [[Kohor]].  [[Kohor]] is an ancient city of [[The First Men]], whom the Karbolds are decended from.  The Karbolds still hold to many traditions of [[The First Men]], but have bent knee to [[The Viridian Empire]] so long ago that the few tribal [[Kells|Kell]] that remain, who have changed little since the days of [[The First Men]] are like savages to them.

Light of hair, and thick of muscle, Karbolds have always been fierce warriors and shrewd tacticians.  Their crest is a grey bear's paw on a black field.

For example 1 gold coin in [[Asha]] is worth 10 in traditional [[D&amp;D]].  Likewise something that costs 1 gold in [[D&amp;D]] would cost 1 silver in [[Asha]]. |
| [[Arcane Focus Rules|Arcane Focus]] |[[Wizards|Wizardry]] require the use of an [[Arcane Focus]] to cast all but the most rudimentary spells.  This focus varies by culture and availability of materials, but the result is the same: a [[semi-sentient object|Arcane Focus]] that can both withstand and act as a conduit to manifest more accurate, potent and complex spellcraft.   |

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/humans.jpg]]
The Human race dominates [[Asha]] with sheer numbers.  Known more commonly as the race of “Man” they currently comprise a leading majority of the planet’s population, and their civilization dominates much of the known world - hence the current Age being known as [[The Age Of Man|The Fourth Age]].

Mankind's spread has quickly grown, taking advantage of the empty spaces vacated by the once great [[Sylvan Empire|The Sylvan Empire]].  However, their civilization is still in its infancy.

While the other races of [[Asha]] such as the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] and [[Elves|Elf]] each possess an origin that ties them to [[The Gods]], Humans have no such connection.  Their origins are mysterious and unknown, thought to have sprung from the final spark of the dying [[Valouria]].

Currently, the realms of [[Asha]] are home to countless Kingdoms, Empires, social groups, or clans who all differ in culture and background.  These differences are enough to create language or cultural barriers which can make communication between the Human sub-species difficult.  However, trade has out of necessity formed a [[Language]] known as [[The Common Tongue]] which most civilized parts of [[Asha]] has a means of understanding.

| [&gt;img[images/races/variant-human/amonite-portrait.jpg][Amonite]] &lt;br&gt;[[Amonite]] |[[Amonites|Amonite]] are reknowned as artisans, scholars, and soldiers.  The [[Amonite]] have spread throughout [[Asha]], as [[The Amoni Empire]] once spanned to almost half of the known world.  [[Amonites|Amonite]] often have dark hair, olive skin and green, gray or amber eyes.  There native language, [[Amoni]] was so widespread at the height of [[The Amoni Empire]] a derivative of it is known as [[The Common Tongue]]. |
| [&gt;img[images/races/variant-human/kell-portrait.jpg][Kell]] &lt;br&gt;[[Kell]] |[[The Kell|Kell]] trace their roots back to [[The First Men]] of [[Kellos]]; the original native Humans of the continent which bears their name.  The [[Kell]] of [[Kellos]] shake off the shackles of [[civilization|The Viridian Empire]] and live a tribal existence not unlike their forebearers.  Once locked in a long fought bitter war against the [[Kellonite]], they seek now only to be left peacefully to tend their herds.  Their hair colors range from blonde to red or brown. |
| [&gt;img[images/races/variant-human/kellonite-portrait.jpg][Kellonite]] &lt;br&gt;[[Kellonite]] |[[The Kellonite|Kellonite]] are a product of the mixture of [[Amonite]] and [[Kell]], found native to the continent of [[Kellos]].  Their culture is a melting pot, and seen as one of the dominant forces on [[Asha]]; very focused on inclusion and trade.  [[The Viridian Empire]] which rules over [[Kellos]] bears symbolism of [[Amonite]], [[Uskardeen]], and [[Kell]] cultures, as well as other [[Races]] such as [[Dwarf]], [[Elf]], and [[Orc]].  Their language has been adopted as [[The Common Tongue]]. |
| [&gt;img[images/races/variant-human/uskardeen-portrait.jpg][Uskardeen]] &lt;br&gt;[[Uskardeen]] |[[The Uskardeen|Uskardeen]] hail from a culture that narrowly escaped [[destruction|The Destruction Of Uskard]] of their continent of [[Uskard]], when a cataclysm of [[Blood Magic]] nearly destroyed their civilization in [[The Fourth Age]].  They take pride in their culture's legacy, and to this day do not see [[Blood Magic]] as taboo if used safely. They often have black hair, brown eyes, and dark to cool brown skin. |
| [&gt;img[images/races/variant-human/rujevian-portrait.jpg][Rujevian]] &lt;br&gt;[[Rujevian]] |[[The Rujevian|Rujevian]] rarely travel outside of their homeland of [[Ruje]], as travel outside of their cities is both difficult and dangerous.

They are ruled by the immortal [[Aurum]], who they place in high regard; almost religious significance. |

|Name|ImageSizePlugin|
|Source|http://www.TiddlyTools.com/#ImageSizePlugin|
|Version|1.2.3|
|Author|Eric Shulman|
|License|http://www.TiddlyTools.com/#LegalStatements|
|~CoreVersion|2.1|
|Type|plugin|
|Description|adds support for resizing images|
This plugin adds optional syntax to scale an image to a specified width and height and/or interactively resize the image with the mouse.
!!!!!Usage
&lt;&lt;&lt;
The extended image syntax is:
{{{
[img(w+,h+)[...][...]]
}}}
where ''(w,h)'' indicates the desired width and height (in CSS units, e.g., px, em, cm, in, or %). Use ''auto'' (or a blank value) for either dimension to scale that dimension proportionally (i.e., maintain the aspect ratio). You can also calculate a CSS value 'on-the-fly' by using a //javascript expression// enclosed between &quot;&quot;&quot;{{&quot;&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;&quot;}}&quot;&quot;&quot;. Appending a plus sign (+) to a dimension enables interactive resizing in that dimension (by dragging the mouse inside the image). Use ~SHIFT-click to show the full-sized (un-scaled) image. Use ~CTRL-click to restore the starting size (either scaled or full-sized).
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Examples
&lt;&lt;&lt;
{{{
[img(100px+,75px+)[images/meow2.jpg]]
}}}
[img(100px+,75px+)[images/meow2.jpg]]
{{{

Imameli, roughly translated from [[Elvish]] as &quot;the harvester of love&quot; is a [[Kiraga]] sworn to [[Azarad-Ji]] that aided in [[The Third Desecration]].  She was once a young [[Elven|Elf]] maiden who fell in love with [[Raime Wesewierë]] due to his kind heart and gentle soul.  Being a prophet and holy man, he gently rejected her advances.  She took the news roughly.  Heartbroken, she found it impossible to get over her love for [[Raime Wesewierë]].

She sought a means to obtain the love that was beyond her reach, and [[Zezebazum]] appeared in his natural hideous form.  After overcoming her fear, [[Zezebazum]] explained how the two of them have similar goals.  The [[Dathairä]] explained how [[Raime Wesewierë]] was key to his plans, and was to be the ruler of [[Asha]] after the [[Desecration]].  [[Zezebazum]] needed [[Raime Wesewierë]], and Imameli would be the means by which he would get him.  If she were to sway [[Raime Wesewierë]], [[Zezebazum]] bargained that he would ensure the two of them would rule together.

Greedily agreeing to the bargain, she became the [[Kiraga]] known forevermore as Imameli.  Her transformation gave her horns, and wings - and charm and control spells to ensnare the opposite sex.  As history has recorded, she failed in her attempt to convert [[Raime Wesewierë]].</pre>

All objects emit this radiation naturally, which allows the individual to see even in absolute darkness. Gain advantage to any Tracking rolls if the trail is no more than an hour old, assuming the tracks were made by a creature that emits heat. A sudden flash of heat, such as a magical fire blinds the individual for 1d4 rounds.</pre>

<pre>__Disadvantage: Intolerance For Magic (-5 Points)__

Characters with an intolerance for [[Magic]] see all forms of [[Magic]] as unnatural and wrong.  Their resentment is most likely tied to the [[Azutan Nagyos]], the historical banning of magic from [[The Viridian Empire]] some 1,000 years ago.  While [[Magic]] is once again tolerated by the general population, there remain some who understand the razor's edge the world of [[Asha]] is balancing on between [[Magic]] and [[The Fourth Desecration]].</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Kiraga/iraki.jpg]]

Iraki, meaning &quot;Child Of Darkness&quot; in [[Elvish]] is a [[Kiraga]] sworn to [[Azarad-Ji]] that aided in [[The Third Desecration]].  Prior to falling to darkness and becoming a [[Kiraga]], he was known as Mathu'eire (translation &quot;sea friend&quot;).  He was a famous sailor and explorer with a taste for adventure.  He was the first [[Elf]] to circumnavigate the globe, and bring back detailed maps of [[Asha]].  He explored in order to find evidence of the civilization he believed existed in [[The First Age]], a time in which [[mankind|Human]] ruled over nature with technology and science.  Mathu'eire became renowned for finding trinkets of [[The First Age]], but his exploring kept him away from his wife and children for long periods of time - filling him with an intense longing.

His final adventure had him returning triumphantly home after finding a great number of artifacts from [[The First Age]].  To his horror, he found his city ransacked by [[Orcs|Orc]] and his wife, children and kinsman dead.  Unbeknownst to Mathu'eire, the [[Dathairä]] [[Zezebazum]] was behind the murder of the townsfolk - his plan to bring Mathu'eire to a moment of weakness and despair.  Devastated by the death and destruction, Mathu'eire was at his breaking point and very vulnerable.

[[Zezebazum]], disguised as a trusted sailing companion, explained how he had unlocked the secrets of one of the artifacts from [[The First Age]].  A metallic gauntlet with a short sharp spike protruding from the wrist, with the ability to resurrect the dead.  [[Zezebazum]] showed with feigned excitement at how he was able to bring back an animal from the dead by using the spike on the gauntlet at the base of the animal's skull.  Excited at the prospect of bringing back his family, Mathu'eire grabbed to gauntlet and rushed to the bodies of his loved ones.  [[Zezebazum]] warned that he was dabbling with powerful and unknown forces beyond his control, and advised Mathu'eire to stop.  Without hesitation, Mathu'eire used the artifact to bring his family and friends back, only to find them reanimate as corpses incapable of thought.

Mathu'eire fell quickly into a deeper spiral of darkness and madness, incapable of destroying those he loved - even if they were simply more than mindless creatures.  Unable to live with himself, he begged his companion (which was really [[Zezebazum]]) to end his life and allow him to rejoin his loved ones.  [[Zezebazum]] triumphant in bringing to his knees one of the greatest [[Elves|Elf]] of [[The Third Age]], informed Mathu'eire that this was a grave and sullen path that he was traveling - and joining his family would bring nothing but darkness and more despair.  Grief stricken, Mathu'eire begged to join his family - and [[Zezebazum]] obliged by turning him into the [[Kiraga]] Iraki - an unliving entity capable of cheating death and spawning creature of death and destruction for his companions.</pre>

//Knowledge of the future grants power over the present.  For that reason, Ithrael, the angel of Fate is a vital member of [[The Seven]].  He can decipher [[El'druin]], which grants him sight and perspective others cannot fully comprehend.//

}}}

Ithrael is an [[Archangel]], one of [[The Seven]] that watch over [[Elysium]].  He serves as the lorekeeper of [[The Seven]], his domain is Fate.  It is his role on the council to decipher the arcane and esoteric [[El'druin, The Scroll Of Fate|El'druin]], written by [[Qualok]] himself.  Ithrael has been described as distant and aloof - spending all of his free time with [[The Scroll|El'druin]] or some lost tome.

!Fate Unclear
{{quote{
//[[Humanity|Human]] is itself a paradox.  They possess both taint and promise inherent within...  Left to grow, they might become more monstrous than anything rising from out of [[Baator]].  But they also have the greatest potential to serve the Light... a potential that could even surpass our own roles... [[El'druin]] is silent on them, but they are clearly children of [[Valouria]] and so I vote that they be given their chance.//
''-Ithrael, discussing humanity's fate''
}}}
Ithrael has mastered using [[The Scroll Of Fate|El'druin]] to predict the actions of [[Azarad-Ji]] and his [[Dathairä]].  He also was correct in his prediction that [[Shalekasha's|Shalekasha]] actions were most likely to have dire consequences for [[Elysium]].  It is important to note that he cannot see the future outright, but rather he has the ability to see various possibilities played out as the results of actions in the present.  He cannot apply this ability to [[Human]] actions though, which confounds him and is a source of frustration.  It was how he failed to see the magnitude of [[Shalekasha's|Shalekasha]] intervention in [[Human]] affairs at the end of [[The Third Age]].

<div title="Ivo Quintana" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202309170126" modified="202408032055" tags="person" changecount="29">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/ivo-quintana.jpg]]
Ivo Quintana ([[Hassomir]] 426 - Current or 184 [[AAP]] - Current) is the current [[Octarch]] of [[Tszanthus]] on the continent of [[Ruje]].  He has ruled [[Tszanthus]] for over 800 years with the aid of life extending [[Sorcery]] known as [[Galvanism]] only the wealthy [[Aurum]] can afford.  He has a mysterious and regal bearing, preferring to keep both his allies and enemies off guard with sly innuendo and political maneuvers.  Though his body remains that of a younger man, his eyes betray a depth that hints at the weight of accumulated experiences.

Quintana possesses extreme wealth, influence and long life.  He has twenty-one children across multiple consorts, and actively prevents his family from inheriting anything in the event of his &quot;real death&quot;.  He goes so far as to keep his only son, [[Kono Quintana]], in a younger body to prevent him from developing into manhood and surpassing his father.

!Personality
Ivo Quintana, like many [[Aurum]] possesses an extreme megalomaniac personality brought on by their wealth, influence and long life.  He enjoys keeping others off balance, often through other underestimating his knowledge, talent and desire.

!Sponsor Of Artifice
The dawn of [[Artifice]] in [[Ruje]] began in [[Tszanthus]] in [[Hassomir]] 1179 / 937 [[AAP]] when Ivo Quintana was 763 years of age.  A young inventor by the name of [[Kazimir Angelus Nikomedes]] harnessed the power of the [[Highstorm]] and [[Dravarian Silver Sand]] and invent [[The Sympathy Lamp]].  Seeing the infinite possibilities, Ivo instead of purchasing a handful of [[Lamps|The Sympathy Lamp]], purchased the rights to manufacture them for a sum of 1,000 golden coins.  A fortune to [[Kazimir|Kazimir Angelus Nikomedes]] but a paltry sum to the [[Octarch]] of [[Tszanthus]], [[Kazimir|Kazimir Angelus Nikomedes]] took the deal.  A decision he would later regret as he became horrified how his invention was exploited.  It was this that led to [[Kazimir|Kazimir Angelus Nikomedes]] creating of [[The Guild Of Illuminators]].

Despite this, Ivo Quintana remained a strong financial supporter of [[The Guild Of Illuminators]], keenly aware of the prestige [[The Guild|The Guild Of Illuminators]] brought to [[the city|Tszanthus]].  Ivo was present in [[Kazimir's|Kazimir Angelus Nikomedes]] final moments, when he foolishly chose to place the conducting rod atop the newly created [[Horologuim]], only never to be heard from again.  While many assume foul play on the part of Ivo Quintana, the [[Octarch]] always is saddened by the mention of [[Kazimir Angelus Nikomedes]] - and suggests one of the brightest minds of [[Asha]] was lost that night and the city misses him dearly. 

!Retinue

He has served his master for many decades, and is fiercely loyal.  [[Ivo|Ivo Quintana]] has tested this loyalty multiple times throughout their working together, and trusts [[Rodolf|Rodolf Naulabates]] with many things he would trust no other with - specifically handling his affairs in the event of his body's death. |
| [img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/wi-otondo-portrait.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Wi Otondo]] |[[Wi Otondo]] is the current consort for [[Ivo Quintana]].  She is mother of [[Polox Quintana]], the [[Octarch's|Octarch]] only son.  She is from a wealthy [[Aurum]] family in the city of [[Horada]] and is devoutly faithful to [[The Church Of The Final Atonement]].  |

!Former Retinue
| [img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/polox-quintana-portrait.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[Polox Quintana]] |[[Polox Quintana]] was the only son and heir to [[Ivo Quintana]], [[Octarch]] of [[Tszanthus]].  His father continued to keep him in the body of a younger man just into his teenage years to prevent him from developing into manhood and surpassing him.  [[Polox|Polox Quintana]] chafed at this, and was as much as prisoner within the [[Octarch's|Octarch]] palace as a family member.  He died in the plague that overcame [[Tszanthus]] in 16 [[Auphyra]], [[Hassomir]] 1268 when the [[Elven|Elf]] [[Soul]] that was granted him by [[The Reliquary of Tszanthus]] was stripped from him. |

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/kellos/the-keep/deepwater/jacob-jedaleon.jpg]]
Jacob Jadaleon III (c. 957 [[AAP]] - 1025 [[AAP]]) was the [[Emperor]] of [[The Viridian Empire]].  Ruler of the [[Kell]] and the [[Amonite]] and the [[Uskardeen]].  He was [[Marshall]] of [[The Keep]], [[Shield]] of [[Deepwater]] and head of [[House Jedaleon]].  He is the father of [[Galad Jedaleon]], [[Greco Jedaleon]], and [[Natalia Jedaleon]].

The only son of [[Jayce Jedaleon II]] and [[Freya Bryne]], Jacob was groomed for rule.  He served as ward to his uncle [[Huster Bryne]], along with [[Orm Karbold]].  The two wards learned swordplay and political matters while becoming good childhood friends.  In these young tender years Jacob fell ill and was on his deathbed.  He asked for his last rites and confessed his sins, and miraculously recovered.

Jacob assumed the throne and was known as a patron of the arts.  He commissioned great works such as the [[Tower Of Deepwater]], [[The Deepwater Naval Academy]] and the [[The Temple Of The Divine]].

Jacob later married [[Katerin Karbold]] in 1005 [[AAP]], sister of [[Orm Karbold]].  This was a marriage of love, not political convenience.  He was promised at a young age to [[Lara Conlon]], of [[Derby]] to continue in solidifying the thin alliance between [[House Jedaleon]] and [[House Bryne]].  His rebuke caused what became known as [[The Siege Of Derby]], as [[The Fisher's League]] ceased trade relations with [[The Viridian Empire]].

He and [[Katerin Karbold]] had beautiful children, yet she died in childbirth in 1017 [[AAP]].  Jacob entered a severe depression over losing the love of his life, which he continued to suffer from until his death.

He died in 1025 [[AAP]] during the events of [[The Black Night]].</pre>

<pre>This city of Jakah is located within [[Uskard]].  It is the former imperial city prior to [[The Destruction Of Uskard]], and is now the fourth largest city in [[The Nissido Dynasty]].  It lies south of the foothills of [[The Temno Mountains]] (&quot;Darkspine&quot; in Common).  The red walls of the city were built by [[Nasar Zeuxis]] in 34 [[IO]], and various buildings constructed in red sandstone after any wooden structures were razed to the ground by the [[Dragon]] [[Aglanore]] in 29 [[IO]].  This gave rise to the cities nickname: &quot;The Red City&quot;.

It was [[Saba Yusuf]], wife of [[Dariush Yusuf]], who developed an underground water system in the city known as the [[Rhettara]] to irrigate her new garden in 210 [[IO]].  This ancient water system survives today, allowing for the city to be blanketed in foliage despite being located within the arid climate of the north.

The city is a haphazard maze of cramped streets and plazas, packed with vendors (known as &quot;Souks&quot;) and their colorful stalls.

He is a robust man with a set of scars across his left eye, leaving it blind.  He has an appreciation of antiquities and historical artifacts thanks to his days as a youth scavenging ruins across [[Uskard]].|

!Places Of Interest
*[[The Imperial Gardens]] - while the city is home to a number of gardens, the largest and oldest is [[The Imperial Gardens]] once curated by [[Saba Yusuf]] and later donated to the people of the city as a public space.  They are centered around a large water reservoir surrounded by orchards and olive groves.
*[[The Palace Of The Way]] - or &quot;Palata na patot&quot; is [[Uskardeen]] is the oldest temple of [[The Way]], and the oldest known temple on [[Asha]], being built during [[The Second Age]].  A time when [[Humans|Human]] were struggling for survival.  It is common for practitioners to pilgrimage here.  Upon arriving one customarily meditates among [[The Pavilion Of The Four Ways]]. </pre>

Jakus (979 [[AAP]] - Current) is the is the Lord [[Shield]] of [[Brand]], [[Bannerman]] to [[House Anwyn]], and the head of [[House Saxon]]. He is known to be strict and stern, but just. Jakus respects the need for discipline and the chain of command, and is harsh on those in his service who do not. He has seen battle, and is a skilled commander - and often runs the city as if it is a garrison. He is a blood relative (nephew) to his liege Lord [[Keltar Anwyn]].

At the age of 29 he fought in [[The War Of The Shores]], where he was called into battle to defend against [[Orcish|Orc]] tribes who were ravaging the coast of [[The Viridian Empire]].  In battle he slayed [[Xarpug The Large]], a [[Troll]] who was terrorizing the citizens of [[The Golden Shores]]; earning him accommodations from the [[Emperor]] known as [[&quot;The Warrior's Heart&quot;|The Warrior's Heart]].

Jakus is strong of will and stubborn, however is very slow to anger.  He has much love for his son [[Janus Saxon]], who he wishes to have the strength and nobility worthy of [[House Saxon]].  When his wife, [[Iyla Thorson]] died in 1005 [[AAP]] to [[The Red Pox]], he grew more distant and cold of heart.  He would often seek solitude, or release his frustration on the training ground.

Jakus is a proud man, but not too proud to accept help in defending the needs of [[Brand]].  He works closely with [[The Grey Companions]] and [[The Crimson Order]], wishing only the best for his people.  Although many close to him would say he favors [[The Grey Companions]], even more so now that his son [[Janus|Janus Saxon]] is dating [[Minerva Carrington]].  Jakus approves of their relationship, seeing a positive change in [[Janus|Janus Saxon]] - and enjoying seeing his son truly happy.

When Jakus is around [[Minerva Carrington]] and [[Janus|Janus Saxon]], he suddenly transforms into a much softer, much happier, joyful man.  Their relationship reminds him of the fond times he had with [[Ilya Thorson]], and he is living vicariously through them.  He keeps pestering them on when they will get married, and insists that he takes care of all of the details.  He looks forward to the day he is a grandfather, and would be proud to have [[Minerva Carrington]] as a daughter.</pre>

They have been in a relationship for nearly a year, and it has become very public as the two of them are some of the most famous people in [[Brand]].  The citizens love them, and they are the city's power couple.

As a noble in line to inherit his father's position - he carries himself with a sense of entitlement which can be off putting to those who interact with him.  Raised in privilege he is overconfident, and considers those not of noble birth beneath him, something [[Minerva Carrington]] is grooming out of him.

As a young child, Janus was very close to his mother [[Iyla Thorson]].  They would attend church together, and he has fond memories of her charity work with the less fortunate of [[Brand]]; she would provide food, clothing, and in a few instances shelter for those in the most need.  Her devotion to [[The Gods]] was so great that she was gifted with [[Divine Power]].  He remembers the final kiss that she gave him when he was only five years old and she left the house for the last time to care for others in [[Brand's|Brand]] most dire time of need, a strange virus known as [[The Red Pox]] in 1005 [[AAP]].  This outbreak was resistant to [[Magic]], but that did not deter her; she cared for the sick and poor within [[The Warrens]] and herself became ill.  She succumbed to the illness, changing [[Jakus|Jakus Saxon]] and Janus's lives forever, but being memorialized by those of [[The Warrens]] as [[The Mother Of Brand]].

He grew up a bitter child with a father who was overly strict and harsh due to sorrow.  Janus despised [[The Warrens]] for taking his mother from him both in name and in body.  This made him smug and unbearable, traits his father could not correct with discipline; despite his best efforts.  He remained this way for some time, until he first heard the calling of [[Xander]].  Remarkably, he hears the voice of [[Xander]] when in times of stress and peril; driving him towards a life of [[Religion]] in the service of [[The Divine Order]].  He has become a devout [[Cleric]] of [[Xander]], imbued with [[Divine Favor]] like his mother.

He has grown from a petulant boy to a driven, focused, disciplined, and ambitious young man.</pre>

The Jötnar are giant humanoids that resemble gargantuan [[Humans|Human]] that average between 16-26 feet tall, birthed from [[Valouria's|Valouria]] spirit after [[The First Desecration]].  They abide by a [[Religion]] they call [[The Ordning]] or &quot;The Order Of Things&quot;.  All Jötnar feel [[The Ordning]], and their individual place within it.  It is a caste system based upon social rank of each Jötuun.  No two Jötuun are equal in rank, and all Jötuun intuitively know their place amongst the others.

!The Ordning
[[The Ordning]] is as much a religion as it is a social construct.  All Jötnar feel the pull of [[The Ordning]] which allows them to sense their place and rank.  They subscribe to the concepts of [[Maat]] and [[Maug]] in which some actions increase ones standing in [[The Ordning]] ([[Maat]]) and other reduce it ([[Maug]]).

!The Thrym
[[The Thrym]] (pronounced &quot;thrim&quot;) are Jötnar that live outside of [[The Ordning]].  There are tales of rare situations of Jötnar children born without a place in the order.  These abominations are killed out of mercy, but there are tales told to scare Jötnar children of groups of [[Thrym|The Thrym]] that live in deep remote places and capture Jötuun who do not listen to their elders.

!Life in Seclusion
Jötnar prefer to live together in strongholds and [[Steddings|Stedding]] far from other sentient beings, however they are known to trade with merchants brave enough to enter their domain and treat their ways with honor and respect.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/items/combat-styles/kaethu.jpg]]
Kaethu, or &quot;Water Dancing&quot;, is a fighting style focusing on combat with a [[Kahedafa]] &quot;dancing sword&quot;.  It is considered a form of combat as well as a performing art prevalent in [[The Sylvan Empire]].  It is characterized by fast acrobatic maneuvers, including cartwheels and somersaults.  Striking techniques are works of beauty and terrible power.  The acrobatics serve as feints; one never knows what to expect from a Kaethu master.  Perfected by [[Elves|Elf]] during [[The Sylvan Empire]] in [[The Third Age]], it remains prevalent among portions of the [[Variona'Sha]].

''Kaethu (Physical/Hard)''
This represents the skill in Kaethu, and allows the character to learn the maneuvers of this style.  Additionally, it grants the use of the [[Kahedafa]] &quot;dancing sword&quot; in both the one and two handed variants.  Swing damage is increased by 1 when swinging the sword two-handed.  Parry when used one handed is 1/2 skill.  Used two-handed, and carrying no more than Light Encumbrance, Parry is 2/3 skill.  This style teaches a fighting stance that is resistant to Slam attacks or attempts to knock the fighter down.  Resist with a bonus of 1/10 this skill.

''Acrobatics''
Practitioners of Kaethu are skilled Acrobats and required to take the Acrobatics skill. see [B48]

''Parry Missile Weapons (Physical/Hard)''
Allows the parry of a missile or thrown weapon.  A character with Toughness + 2 or higher, or wearing armored gloves may parry with their hands.  Arrows are parried at no penalty; darts and crossbow bolts are parried at -5.  Thrown hand weapons are easy to parry for someone with this skill; +2 for knives, +4 for larger weapons.  The actual Parry is 1/2 the Parry Missile Weapons Skill.

''Hit Location [Kahedafa] (Hard)''
This maneuver lets the attacker reduce the penalties for aiming at a hit location using a [[Kahedafa]] &quot;dancing sword&quot;.  One does not roll against the Hit Location maneuver to use it; instead, each level of Hit Location gives the attacker a bonus that can be used to offset hit location penalties.  This bonus is +1 if Hit Location is known at Skill-2, +2 if it is known at Skill-1, and +3 if it is known at Skill.  No further improvement is possible.  This bonus can never result in the attack being made at a higher level than the prerequisite skill; it can //only// be used to offset hit location penalties.

''Stop Hit [Kahedafa] (Hard) - cannot exceed Kahedafa skill ''
This is an attack launched at the same time an enemy attacks!  The combatant using the Stop Hit is effectively surrendering his Active Defense.  On the other hand, the original attacker cannot defend either, unless he abandons his attack and tries to use an Active Defense; if he does that, he is still at -1 to defend against the Stop Hit.
If both fighters press on with their attacks, roll a Quick Contest between the attacker's weapon skill and the defender's Stop Hit; the one with the highest Move gets a +1 on the contest.  The winner rolls to hit first; if he hits and does damage, assess any shock and stunning penalties on the wounded character and //halve// them before applying them to his own attack.  Even if the wound is enough to stun the enemy, he can still roll for his attack, at -4 or minus the damage taken, whichever is higher.  On a tie, rolls to hit and damage are taken simultaneously, with effects taking place in the following turn.
This maneuver can result in both fighters being killed or incapacitated, so is rarely used in lethal combat.  A character using a Stop Hit is very vulnerable to Ripostes and Feints; a common fencing tactic consists in inviting a Stop Hit with a Feint, and then attacking the off-balance character.  If someone uses a Stop Hit in response to a Feint, he is at -3 skill to resist the feint.

''Feint (Hard)''
This maneuver is identical to the feint described on [B105].  It can be raised up to four levels past the prerequisite level.</pre>

<pre>A Kahedafa is an [[Elven|Elf]] sword common to the [[Varigellë]] of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  It is long and slightly curved, with a two-handed grip that can be wielded either one or two handed during combat.  In [[Elvish]] the word Kahedafa is translated to &quot;dancing sword&quot;, as it was accompanied by a warrior trained in a unique fighting style known as [[Kaethu]] or &quot;water dancing&quot; that mixed graceful movements and powerful attacks.

When used two handed, the weapon does +1 swinging damage and when paired with [[Elvish]] fighting technique can parry with 2/3 skill.  Kahedafa are customarily sheathed in an ornate hardwood scabbard.  A scabbarded kahedafa was used against an unworthy enemy to subdue without killing.  The following statistics are for a kahedafa of Good quality, however most kahedafa were of Fine quality or better.

Kandar is one of [[The Elder Gods]], as old as time itself.  Legends depict Kandar as a large serpent-like creature with three eyes in its head and many eyes along its endless infinite body.  It lies within a layer of [[The Abyss]] filled with salt water and rocky prominences used as rookeries by winged abominations.

Kandar has outgrown the layer of [[The Abyss]] it calls home, and is imprisoned under its own mass and size.  Kandar slumbers, awaiting to build enough power and energy to expand its territory.

!Worship
The worshipers of Kandar are more likely to be scaly things that hide from the light that [[Humans|Human]] or members of other civilized [[Races]] create.  Despite Kandar's stature in [[The Abyss]], the vast majority of [[Asha]] are blissfully ignorant of its existence.  A slim few have heard of it's name in whispers and nothing more.  Only scholars, arcanists, and those with a particular interest in [[The Elder Gods]] know who and what it is.</pre>

Sister to [[Orm Karbold]], she was free spirited and possessed the beauty of [[The Northlands]].  She had high cheekbones, deep blue eyes, and thick soft blonde hair.  Raised as a lady, Katerin was interested in music, poetry, fine arts, singing and dancing, and other traditional feminine activities.  She was enthralled by songs and stories of romance and adventure, particularly those depicting handsome princes, honorable knights, chivalry, and love.

[[Jacob Jedaleon III]] would visit her brother [[Orm Karbold]] in [[Kohor]], and despite their age difference they had much in common.  [[Jacob|Jacob Jedaleon III]] carried himself with honor and grace, and Katerin saw him as one of her storybook knights.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/kazimir-angelus-nikomedes/kazimir-angelus-nikomedes.jpg]]
Kazimir Angelus Nikomedes ([[Hassomir]] 1161 - [[Hassomir]] 1228 or 919 [[AAP]] - 986 [[AAP]]) was a [[Sorcerer|Sorcery]], inventor, mathematician, and futurist who lived in the city of [[Tszanthus]] on the continent of [[Ruje]].  He is best known for his design of the [[Entropy Siphon]] and [[The Horologuim]] and the invention of modern day [[Artifice|Artificer]].  Knowing his inventions and experiments would cause harm in the wrong hands, he founded the secretive [[Guild Of Illuminators|The Guild Of Illuminators]].

!The Early Years
Kazimir was born to [[Alfontso|Alfontso Nikomedes]] and [[Lexuri Nikomedes|Lexuri Acrodina Nikomedes]] in [[The Upper Streap]].  His mother, [[Lexuri|Lexuri Acrodina Nikomedes]] was a skilled [[Medica|The Medica]] in [[Baldarrain University]] until she was overcome with madness and admitted into [[The White Garden Asylum For The Mentally Insane]].  Unable to make ends meet, Kazimir's father was forced to move to [[The Lower Streap]] and live out the remainder of his life in squalor.

Kazimir was formed by [[The Lower Streap]], and it was there where he acquired his fascination with [[Highstorms|Highstorm]].  He was an inquisitive child who would naturally seek to experiment in order to answer questions of the world around him.  Living on [[The Lower Streap]] formed his character; causing him to become more cunning, resourceful, and resilient.

!The Invention Of Artifice
In [[Hassomir]] 1179 / 937 [[AAP]], at the age of 18, Kazimir had his first breakthrough known as the first invention of [[Artifice|Artificer]].  He recognized a link between [[Dravarian Silver Sand]] and [[Highstorms|Highstorm]] which allowed the sand to be smelted into glass that could hold a portion of the energy of [[The Storms|Highstorm]].  His first invention is commonly known as [[The Hell Whip]], a hand-held device with an extendable filament of flexible [[Dravarian Silver Glass]] electrified by a portion of a [[Highstorm]].  Overwhelmed by the prospect of coin, he sold it and the rights to its manufacturing to [[Ivo Quintana]], the [[Octarch]] of [[Tszanthus]].  All guards within the city carry one to this day, and [[The Guild Of Illuminators]] are still forced to create them at cost due Kazimir naively selling the patent.

Horrified of how his invention was exploited, Kazimir founded [[The Guild Of Illuminators]] in [[Hassomir]] 1180 / 938 [[AAP]], vowing never to give away such potent knowledge ever again.  He named them after his invention of [[The Sympathy Lamp]], which can be found in many of the streets of [[Tszanthus]] providing light during dark nights and overcast days.

!His Crowning Achievement
His crowning achievement was the building of a clocktower known as [[The Horologuim]] in [[Hassomir]] 1228 / 986 [[AAP]].  As a rebuff to [[The Aurum]], Kazimir built it inside of [[The Lower Streap]].  It is powered by the [[Highstorms|Highstorm]] and is the most complicated and grand [[Artifice]] on [[Asha]].  Kazimir was personally involved in all of its design and construction, and insisted that it was he that placed the final conducting rod; due to the precision required.  It was a dangerous operation, as it needed to be placed and calibrated during a [[Highstorm]].  Known to be one of the most potent storms of the century, he was alone inside of [[The Horologuim]] with the [[Octarch]] [[Ivo Quintana]] himself.  As he placed the conducting rod, it was hit with a massive strike from a [[Highstorm]] leading to its first chime heard throughout the city and his death.  Many mysteries surround his death, for his body was never recovered.</pre>

|![[Guide To Roleplaying A Kell]]|
|![[Click Here For Information on The Old Tongue|The Old Tongue]]|

Kells are nomadic barbarians located in the Northwestern highlands of [[Kellos]].  They are rugged, burly, and strong folk who live in some of the more wild regions of the world.  They can be treated with disdain in the civilized parts of [[Asha]], due to the rare incidents where their tribes cause friction with established cities of [[The Northlands]].  [[The Westron Wall]] was originally built to keep their civilization at bay before [[The Viridian Empire]] occupied [[The Northlands]].  Their culture has been relegated to the more northern regions of [[Kellos]], and some tribes have been culturally absorbed into [[The Viridian Empire]], settling into small villages of their own.

The Kells live a harsh and simple life among the mountainous northern regions of [[Kellos]].  They are descendants of [[The First Men]] to walk upon [[Asha]] in [[The Second Age]], and their culture has remained relatively unscathed.  In their ancient traditions, they do not fear their own death, pain, or suffering - although they are very superstitious.  They have a deep belief in fate and destiny.  Kells can prove useful allies, but never turn to them in weakness.  They are as hard and unforgiving as the mountain stone in which they live.  If you approach in strength, they might consider you a worthy ally.

Kellish hunters speak of stories of the [[Burgonya]], creatures that are half human, half animal - and prey on flesh in the darkest nights.  Every day brings challenge to the Kell.  Food, water, and shelter are rare in their mountainous homes - a single mistake can bring down an entire tribe, while an individual's heroic effort can ensure the entire group's survival.  The Kell take pride in individualistic skill and self-sufficiency.  They love to win, but see defeat as a prod to improve themselves.

For Kell, competition is a means to measure talent, dedication, and effort.  While they will seek any advantage possible, they recognize that reliance on concepts like magic items or money are fickle and fleeting.  The Kell are careful to remember that those that rely too much on them can grow complacent, a recipe for disaster in the mountains.  Their culture has many tales of foolish Kell who relied too heavily on something other than their own innate strength and skill.  This trait manifests most strongly when the Kell interact with other cultures.  The relationship between peasant and noble puzzles the Kell.  If a king lacks the intelligence or leadership to lead, then clearly the most talented person in the kingdom should take his place.  Kell rarely keep such opinions to themselves, and mock folk who rely on society's structures or rules to maintain power. 

Younglings are not named until they are old enough to wield a weapon.  At that time, they participate in the rite of passage of receiving their name.  Once an adult, they are expected to contribute or be expelled from the tribe.  A lone Kell has little chance of survival, especially an older or weaker one.  Kell have little pity for adults who can't take care of themselves, though a sick or injured individual is treated, as a result of the concept of fair play.  A permanently injured Kell is still expected to pull his or her weight in the tribe.  Typically, such a Kell dies attempting to keep up, or slips away in the night to seek the cold will of fate.  This creates a drive to die in battle at peak physical condition rather than wither in the slow decay of old age.

Kells still speak [[The Old Tongue]] of [[The First Men]] they were descended from, yet there is no written form of this language.

A [[Bone Crier]] is the name given to those [[Kell]] who can feel the natural forces of [[Asha]].  Gifted with [[Primal Magic]], they can hear [[Asha]] crying out in their bones.</pre>

Growing up to the size of a small housecat, they at first glance appear to be descendants of [[Wyverns|Wyvern]] with a large frill that they extend as a courtship ritual or when agitated.

Kikasha, roughly translated from [[Elvish]] as &quot;Dark Glory&quot; is a [[Kiraga]] sworn to [[Azarad-Ji]] that aided in [[The Third Desecration]].  His real name is lost to history, but it is known that he was a great [[Varigellë]] general during [[The Sylvan Empire]].  It is said that as a young [[Varigellë]] he jumped in front of a [[Wyvern]] attack to save the life of his commanding officer.  The poisonous sting struck him deep in the chest, and wounded him gravely.  Only the power of the great healers and his strong constitution saved him from the mortal wound.  From that day forward, he took the [[Wyvern]] as a crest.

Later in life, as a general of the [[Varigellë]],  Kikasha was faced with an invading army of [[Orc]].  It was the [[Dathairä]] [[Zezebazum]] who provided the [[Orc]] with the will to throw themselves against the defenses of [[The Sylvan Empire]] in the form of a large and ferocious [[Hydra]].  The invading army was formidable and many [[Elves|Elf]] were dying.  [[Zezebazum]], posing as a sage and historian, offered the whereabouts of a mystic sword to Kikasha, but warned against it's use.

He beguiled and manipulated the fears, wickedness, and doubts within each [[Elf]] - their transformation being under their own free will rather than forced. 

[[Zezebazum]] meant for [[Raime Wesewierë]] to be the final Kiraga.

Without land, a knight is a retainer for their [[Lord]] and do not have the authority to deliver justice.  Knights are permitted retainers in the form of men-at-arms and squires, but can not be the liege of other knights.

Knogs are beasts native to the continent of [[Ruje]].  They are roughly the size of a [[Dog]], with thick leathery skin that ranges in color from drab greys and greens to bright yellows and blues.  Males possess an antennae on their head that can act as a luminescent lure to attract both mates and potential food.  Kogs have long, chameleon-like tongues which can swiftly snatch onto an object before pulling it into their mouths.

They are amphibian, although have lost the evolutionary adaptation to water such as webbing between their paws.  They stand upright on two powerful hind legs, and posses vestigial fore paws that they can use to interact with the environment.  There are many varieties of Knog, having been selectively bred for different purposes.  Some have large frills and fatty lumps on their head and bodies, others are more lean and agile.

!Description
Kohor is the capital of [[The Northlands]], within [[The Viridian Empire]] of [[Kellos]].  It was originally an ancient city of [[The Second Age]], built by [[The First Men]] on a plateau of a mountain.  The only entrance to the city is through a 5 mile inclined mountain pass 30 feet wide.  No army has ever breached the fifth mile and therefore the city is considered impregnable.  The [[Kells|Kell]] held out here against [[The Viridian Empire]] for generations.  This fighting spirit is still found within the populace, who are proud and loyal to the north before their loyalty to [[The Empire|The Viridian Empire]]; many tracing their lineage back to the blood of [[The First Men]].  It is difficult to grow crops in the harsh rocky soil, however there is a mountain spring of crystal clear water that creates a patch of fertile land for crops and grazing of beasts.  The city sits within the middle of a mountain range known as [[The Talon Peaks]], known for being the only habitat for a gargantuan bird known as a [[Roc]].

!The Safest City In The Empire
Kohor is known to be one of the safest cities within [[The Viridian Empire]], due in part to a large portion of the populace who still practice the old ways of the [[Kell]].  Most who live here can trace their heritage back to [[The First Men]], and take pride in the safety of their city.  An average citizen, regardless of age, would gladly take up arms against those who flagrantly violate the rule of law.  Likewise, the hospitality of the cityfolk is akin to that of a small village - where all newcomers and guests who act according to the law being treated with the utmost respect.

!Social Customs
*The locals live in a symbiotic relationship with the [[Roc]] that call the mountains home.  Every year, on [[The Wilding]] (the 13th Of [[Ches]]) when the [[Roc]] are beginning to nest, the people of the city provide offerings of food to the birds.  It is considered good fortune to see a [[Roc]], for they are solitary creatures that live deep within [[The Talon Peaks]].

|![[Click Here For Information on the Dwarvish Language|Dwarvish]]|
The Kombar’Ran (&quot;the clan of god&quot; in the [[Dwarvish]] language) are a race of [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], who live most of their lives underground in the rocky belly of [[Asha]] known as [[The Underdark]].  They are short, sturdy, and about 1½ feet shorter than a [[Human]] of equivalent strength and 50 pounds heavier.  Their features are broad and short, but their heads and torsos are nearly the same size as a [[Human’s|Human]].  Kombar’Ran have thick hair that usually is brown, black or red, though white or blonde are not uncommon.  Kombar’Ran wear thick, full beards which they grow down below their waists.  They wear practical, sturdy clothing, and are often in armor when outside of their home territory.  Dwarves live around 350 years, and therefore the oldest among them remember a much different world.  This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as the [[Humans|Human]] lack.

!The Uuplaund
All Dwarves suffer from a racial fear of open spaces, or Agoraphobia.  They have lived their lives in the confined spaces of [[The Underdark]] and are unerved when there is no ceiling above their head.  Much like a [[Human]] in a cave will feel as if the walls are closing in, Kombar'Ran believe that without a solid ceiling overhead, they will fall 'up' with nothing to keep them on [[Asha]].  They call the surface of [[Asha]] [[The Uuplaund]].  Any Kombar'Ran found outside of [[The Underdark]] will need to have conquered this fear, as a [[Human]] spelunker conquers claustrophobia.

!Dwarven Greed
[[Other races|Races]] see the Kombar'Ran as moody and greedy, most of their lives are spent happily working, singing and drinking. They are shrewd in trade and business, and a Kombar’Ran will never pay more for an item than what is deserved.

!Clans And Kingdoms
The Kombar’Ran regard their homes and families as sacred. All the dwarves are extremely loyal to their clan and [[Stronghold]].  Any Kombar’Ran would come to arms during an invasion (including women, children, and the infirm). The most basic social institution within their society is the clan.  An average Kombar’Ran clan is made up of 35 to 50 adult dwarves and 15 to 30 children, spanning 4 or 5 generations.  The clan is lead by the eldest among them.  Dwarves cherish their clan identities and affilitations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestor's names in oaths and curses.

!The Stone Blessed
Some Kombar'Ran are born with an innate talent for [[Sorcery]].  Those with this talent are called the [[Volg'gogan]] or &quot;Stone Blessed&quot;, and are seen as a deadly contingent of a [[Stronghold's|Stronghold]] defense - possessing both might and [[Magic]].  This ability is a power granted from [[Kombar]], and any children at the age of 15 who possesses the gift are removed form their [[Dwarvish Clan]] and enrolled under the care of [[The Undermountain Papacy]].  Being a [[Volg'gogan]] is one of the highest honors in [[Dwarvish]] culture.

The Korok are a [[Race|Races]] created by the [[Apotheon]] [[ElethaNori]].  They are small, wooden people who live on [[The Planes Of Existence]] known as [[Arborea]] as it was prepared for them by [[ElethaNori]] with a [[Hearttree]].

The average lifespan of a Korok is 300-500 years old, varying in height from 6 to 12 inches tall.  Having wooden bodies, they are light enough to fly through the air with the aid of a leaf. While shy around new people they don't know, they are rather communal creatures and love the company of friends and kin.  The Korok are most known for tending to the flora of [[Arborea]] and raising it to be strong and healthy.  Some talented Korok are even able to make seedlings sprout into trees in the blink of an eye.

Korok traditionally wear masks made of leaves given to them at birth.  The expression is cut into the leaf, reflecting the Korok's personality.

Because they are so tiny and light, they can injure easily but heal fast to compensate.  When a Korok does die, they sprout where they lay into a flower.  Death does not sadden the Korok, and instead it is celebrated.

!Readying The World For The End Of The Cycle
The Korok work tirelessly on the mission given to them by [[ElethaNori]], to prepare [[Arborea]] for the eventual end of [[The Eternal Cycle]].  The Korok worship her as a goddess, and seek to further her domains of FATE, PEACE, and LIFE.  She gave them many gifts, and they take pleasure in using them to further their purpose.  One of the many gifts [[ElethaNori]] gave them was the skill of [[Lysathira]], a tea ceremony that they hold most dear.</pre>

|![[Click Here For Information on the Kuo-Tan Language|Kuo-Tan]]|
Kuo-Toa superficially resemble a grotesque cross between a fish and a humanoid.  They have stout, stocky bodies covered in slippery blue or purple scales, with clawed, webbed feet and black nails.  Their hands are much more [[Human]]-like, ending in the blunt nails typical to most humanoid races.  Where one would normally expect the neck of a humanoid to be, there is instead the head of a fish, placed as if it had been grafted on.  Some Kuo-Toa will display whiskers similar to those of a catfish, others have fins at the sides or tops of their heads, and a few have a mixture of both.  Their bulging lidless-eyes are always a sickly yellow color, with a massive black pupil in the center.

!Masters Of The Sea
Kuo-Toa are only found in the region of [[Ruje]], and hold a closely guarded secret of how to safely sail [[The Moonsea]].  The Kuo-Toa mariners of this region hold a monopoly on water based travel and trade.

!The Motile Isles
The fabled home of the Kuo-Toa is [[The Motile Isles]], a living island chain that travels [[The Moonsea]].  The Kuo-Toa are protective of [[The Motile Isles]], as they hold a quasi-religious significance being the place of their spawning.  Kuo-Toa return to [[The Motile Isles]] in order to spawn and are drawn to do so each year.

!Communications
Their fish mouth shape limits the Kuo-Toa from speaking any language other than [[Kuo-Tan]].  To outsiders, this garbled and guttural language usually sounded more like mere chirps, gurgles and moans that conveyed emotion.  However, [[Kuo-Tan]] is a complex language that due to the unique shape of the Kuo-Toa head and neck make the language difficult and even impossible to speak for most non-Kuo-Toans.  No tongue or lip movement was required to speak, with sounds emanating from the throat and back of the mouth.  Likewise, it is impossible for a Kuo-Toa to speak another language due to their anatomy; inter-species communication involving the Kuo-Toa is carried out in a billingual format, with the Kuo-Toa speaking [[Kuo-Tan]] and the other party speaking another language.

!Customs
* [[Song Chord]] - many Kuo-Toa still hold to an ancient custom of creating a [[Song Chord]] as a mnemonic device as a tactile representation of their own personal history.  One places beads, crystal, bone or shells on the chord to recall major life events.</pre>

Her closest companion is her black [[Dire Wolf]] named Belebha (&quot;Powerful Storm&quot; in [[Elvish]]), who remains protectively at her side at all times.

The [[Fomorians|Fomorian]] fear her wrath, which she gladly quenches with their blood.  She is a husk of her former self, fueled by anger and hate.  [[The Autumn Court]] once held their seat of power in [[Cenedriane]] (&quot;Twilight Breeze&quot; in [[Elvish]]) until it was lost in the war with the [[Fomorians|Fomorian]].

It was under the direction of Lady Selephra that the [[Garathira]] were created.  Twisted constructs of chitin and sinew that are powerful weapons used to protect the borders of [[The Autumn Court]].

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/the-feywild/archfey/velisene.jpg]]
Lady Velisene (&quot;White Gate&quot; in [[Elvish]]) is the [[Queen|Fey Queen]] of [[The Dusk Court]].  She is a formidable hunter, and carries a silver sword said to be able to cut through nightmares.  She is considered benevolent towards mortals, and in awe of those that demonstrate selfless bravery.  Lady Elisene is gifted at [[Dream Walking]], and equally at home within [[Sene'Rine'Rada]] as she is in [[The Feywild]].

!Personality
Velisene is quiet and slow to anger, and willing to hear all sides of story before acting.  She is formal and does not partake in merriment and frivolous acts, although she encourages her subjects to do so in order to rest and gather strength.  Lady Velisene has boundless energy, and is relentless in pursuing goals.  All of this makes her aloof and difficult to approach.  Many fear her, as she has not given them the needed space to understand her motives.  Despite the professional and regal mask that she wears, she is likely the most caring and sensitive of the [[Archfey]].  She believes showing these emotions to be a weakness in herself, but is encouraging those who show them.  She is a guardian of the night, comforting those who fear with both strength and compassion.  Her work is unending, and she devotes her full energy towards it.

!Nabras
The thin curved silver blade that Lady Velisene keeps at her side, is named [[Starfall|The Starfall Blade]]; a gift from the [[Spren]] [[Nabras]].  He crafted it from living dream, allowing her to slice portals to [[Sene'Rine'Rada]] in thin air.  In return, [[Nabras]] has taken from her the child-like playfulness that comes naturally to the [[Fey]].  This deal was struck by Velisene to cause [[Nabras]] to lock [[VanwaHeru]] in an inescapable prison within [[Sene'Rine'Rada]].  Velisene has lost the memory of the prison, as well as the details of the bargain with [[Nabras]], but retains the vague understanding that a deal was struck .  [[Nabras]] fully understands the details of the deal, and retains all memory of the transaction and his bargain.  A fact he teases her with, despite holding his end of the bargain of not revealing any details to anyone.</pre>

<pre>Lake Acharutha (its uncommonly known full [[Elf|Elvish]] name being Acharutha’Kesselu translation: &quot;peaceful lake&quot;) is looked upon with great respect by locals (especially fishermen), and feared by some.  The warm water mixed with the cool northern winds cause a heavy mist to lay upon the surface of the lake.  Local fishermen tell tales that a large beast lives within the depths of the lake’s uncharted bottom.  They all boast of sightings, each more magnificent than the next.

Lake Mistmoor is the largest freshwater lake in [[Kellos]]. The ten cities of [[The Fisher's League]] are found on its shores. Named after its famed mist, the lake is nearly invisible in the morning due to the intense fog. It was [[Kalahad Ferren]] in 812 [[IO]] that discovered there were trace amounts of [[Residuum]] in the water.  He hypothesized that even the small amounts of [[Residuum]] drastically alters the living organisms exposed to the water over long periods of time; evidence in the many flora and fauna unique to the lake. It is unknown if the water affects humanoids, however there are a higher amount of [[Sorcerers|Sorcery]] born in [[The Fisher's League]] than anywhere else on the continent; however, it is very possible that this is due instead to of the attraction of the [[Magicaly Inclined|Magic]] to the soothing waters of the lake. [[Wild Sorcerers|Sorcery]] find the mists of the lake comforting, as it calms their unpredictable surges.

! The Flora And Fauna
There are many unique creatures that call the lake home. The fisherman's favorite is the [[Krall]] fish, which the fishing industry is built around. The name derives from the word &quot;father&quot; in [[The Old Tongue]] due to their frills appearing to look like an old man's beard.  Late in the day, when the fishing nets are pulled in it is a sad sight to see when there are [[Eels|Mezmer]] in the net, the [[Mezmer Eel|Mezmer]] is the bane of the fisherman's life; a nuisance create that is killed on sight.  Late in the evening when the mist is rising, the sailors are guided by the humming sound of the [[Eldergrass]] growing on shore.

One [[Krall]] fish has grown to such an enormous size that he can't be caught in the nets.  The townsfolk have affectionately named him [[Mondo]] and treat him with the care and respect deserving of one of his size an age.</pre>

<pre>The Larabira or &quot;Birth Of The Divine&quot; in [[Elvish]] is a text written by [[Elven|Elf]] prophet [[Raime Wesewierë]] concerning the creation of [[The Gods]] and [[Asha]].

{{quote{
----
''What follows is a fragment of the Larabira''
----

These are the words [[Lucian]] spoke to [[Raime Wesewierë]] concerning the creation of [[Asha]]:

[[Umwe]] opened his eyes and gazed upon his void.  He filled his void with swirling lights, colors and sound.  And this pleased [[Umwe]] for a time.  [[Umwe]] then created his children, and they created great works of art and music in his name.  They sculpted, danced, painted and sang.  And this pleased [[Umwe]].

Four of [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children stood highest in his favor.  [[Kombar]] was an accomplished sculptor.  [[Lucian]] painted with fantastic colors.  [[Qualok]] sang and wrote poetry.  [[Xander]] was a master of dance.

[[Valouria]] arrived when the four were presenting their newest creations to [[Umwe]].  She was not a child of [[Umwe]], and not of this realm.  She was startled, and spoke a strange and unknown tongue.  [[Valouria]] quickly learned their tongue and was able to join her voice with theirs.  She was an exotic beauty who inspired all who laid eyes on her.  Her voice, her dance, and her beauty added to the harmony and this pleased [[Umwe]].

And [[Umwe]] placed [[Valouria]] at the most prominent position in his assembly, and her voice became the melody, her dance and art the centerpiece.  [[The Void]] was filled with beauty the likes of which will never be seen or heard again until the end of [[The Eternal Cycle]].

As their creation progressed, there was a discord.  A dark tone began creeping into the composition, and [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children were frightened.  Most fearful was [[Valouria]], who was the source of the discordance.

And it then came to be that [[Umwe]] found the dark seed inside of her, [[Valouria]] was giving birth to her own child.  Her eyes went black and body limp, all of [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children ceased creating.  From within her, [[Azarad-Ji]] called out to [[Umwe]] &quot;I am the destroyer from [[beyond the void|The Abyss]].  Hidden within this innocent child is your undoing.  Behold!&quot;

[[Azarad-Ji]] burst from [[Valouria]], killing her.  His appearance sickened [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children.  [[Qualok]] and [[Kombar]] rushed to [[Valouria's|Valouria]] side, while [[Xander]] and [[Lucian]] moved to restrain [[Valouria's|Valouria]] twisted offspring.

A fierce battle ensued in which [[Azarad-Ji]] severed one of [[Kombar's|Kombar]] hands, and blinded [[Umwe]].  It was [[Azarad-Ji]] who pierced [[The Void]], allowing his [[Dathairä]] to pour through.  Great losses were had on both sides of the struggle, ending with [[Umwe]] gravely wounded and [[Azarad-Ji]] subdued.

[[Kombar]] sculpted three mighty golems to assist him in crafting a prison for [[Azarad-Ji]] and a tomb for the beloved [[Valouria]].  The first golem was of stone, named [[Golthon]].  The second was of metal, named [[Stellath]].  The third was forged from crystal, named [[Zenriah]].

[[Azarad-Ji]] was beaten but not destroyed, and locked for an eternity in a prison of [[Kombar's|Kombar]] making.

When [[Xander]] lay [[Valouria]] within her magnificent tomb, each of [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children kissed her cheek.  [[Kombar]] named her tomb [[Asha]], and [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children decorated it with flowing water, and beautiful gardens.&quot;

And when she had ended her telling, [[Raime Wesewierë]] paused for a long while.  He then said &quot;Much you tell of the time before [[Asha]], and of [[Umwe]] and his children.  Yet you do not tell of the nature of [[Azarad-Ji]] and [[Valouria]] - from whence they came.&quot;

Lucian continued &quot;It came to be known that [[Azarad-Ji]] and [[Valouria]] were from [[beyond the void|The Abyss]].  A [[domain of chaos|The Abyss]] outside of [[Umwe's|Umwe]] direct control, as even [[Umwe]] must obey [[The Eternal Cycle]].

Now all is said to thee, [[Raime Wesewierë]], concerning the manner of [[Asha]] before the days it became such as [[our children|Races]] have known it.  Of [[our children|Races]] you have not asked, yet I will parlay as to make an end.

The [[Elves|Elf]] are my children, born of [[The Astral Stream]] and gifted with all of the beauty and grace I could afford.  As with [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children, I gifted them with everlasting life, less they die from sorrow or are slain.  And dying they gather in [[The Fields Of Kalara]].  From [[Kombar]] were born the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], strong mighty and bold.  It is not fully understood by me how [[Humans|Human]] entered into [[Asha]], they appeared as if part of the artifice, and none of [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children dared add anything to their fashion.

[[Umwe]] uttered these words before closing his eyes &quot;Behold the beauty of [[Asha]], and the earthly creatures that reside.  They shall conceive more beauty than any of my children.&quot;

And this, [[Raime Wesewierë]], is all I will say for now

!Places Of Interest
* [[Flak’s Flagon]] is one of the best inns in Laranor.  Flak is very attentive to his customers, and keeps a close eye on the patrons.  Having a large troll in the establishment does wonders for keeping customers in-line.
* [[The Lantern]] is a competing inn/tavern within the city.  It is run by a large pasty faced [[Bandorian|Bandor]] named Hestus who inflates all of his prices to encourage bargaining.
* [[The Golden Dice]] is a nightclub and gambling hall.  It is not as good as those in larger cities, but those wishing to try their luck will be presently surprised at the assortment of games.  The rumor is the games are all rigged.
* [[Madam Tralgar’s]] is a brothel.  Madam Tralgar is a [[Darkling]] with connections to some of the more influential [[Deepwater]] [[Darkling Cloaks|Darkling Cloak]].  She is always trying to play sides, attempting to keep her girls busy with underworld customers.  One can find any type of girl they desire here.
* [[The Temple Of Laranor]] was built ages ago by the [[Elves|The Sylvan Empire]] when they once occupied the lands.  The second floor boasts a statue that was carved by the [[Elves|Elf]] themselves.  No [[Human]] is aware of who it is, but it appears to be a likeness of an [[Elven prophet|Raime Wesewierë]].

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/leng.jpg]]
The Leng are extradimensional humanoids that live in a dimension outside of [[The Planes Of Existence]], but somehow connected to [[Sene'Rine'Rada]]; which they appear to be able to freely travel to.  Not much is known about their motivations or place of origination.  They are not evil, but so different from the sentient [[Races]] of [[Asha]] that they might as well be so.  Their actions appear cruel and unfeeling.

They are greyish-white slippery things with a somewhat mutable shape, allowing them to change their general aspect and proportions, but they are not true shapeshifters.  They have no eyes, and use their pink nose tentacles to comprehend their environs even in a complete lack of light.  They are squat and large, up to 400 to 600 pounds and typically 4 to 6 feet tall.

Even the native creatures of [[Sene'Rine'Rada]] give the Leng respect and leave them alone; learning long ago that the Leng are dangerous if provoked.  The Leng largely ignore other species, focused on their own mysterious agendas.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/bestiary/lich.jpg]]
A Lich is the undead form of a powerful [[magician|Magic]] who has sought to preserve their life through unnatural means.  Typically, entering Lichdom requires a great deal of [[Mana]] that requires one drains it from surrounding life-force - meaning becoming a Lich needs the sacrifice of living things; an evil act.  This process generally results in a gaunt skeletal being with withered flesh stretched tight across horribly visible bones. 

A Lich places their essence into a [[Phylactery]], which if destroys kills them forever.  A Lich will stop at nothing to protect their [[Phylactery]].  As long as this [[Phylactery]] is unharmed, the Lich was immortal and would be able to reassemble if it was every vanquished.

!Boneclaws
One that tries and fails to become a [[Lich]] might become a [[Boneclaw]] instead.  These hideous, cackling monsters share a few of the liches' attributes, but while Liches are immortal masters of the arcane, [[Boneclaws|Boneclaw]] are mindless thralls to evil, hatred and pain.  During the most crucial part of the transformation ritual, when the [[Soul]] of the aspiring Lich attempts to migrate to their prepared [[Phylactery]], if one is weak of mind or body the [[Soul]] instead withers.  The body rises as a [[Boneclaw]], with only a primal fragment of the caster's [[Soul]].  The [[Boneclaw]] becomes an [[Undead]] that wantonly destroys the living.

Pearl divers and seafloor scavengers sometimes tell tales of mysterious ocean gardens filled with statues of sea creatures and sailors - the underwater grottoes of the deadly Lindworm.

Supreme Sovereign Lord Llvarana of the Cursed Isles (“The Last Illumination” in [[Elvish]])—the Fomorian ruler of BaraDore—is one of the most feared and enigmatic figures in [[The Feywild]]. Rather than shunning the hideous nature of his court, Llvarana embraces it, reveling in the twisted and vile aspects of existence. He views rival courts as weak for their failure to accept their innate power as apex predators. To him, the truth of one's inner self and the acceptance of the twisted and imperfect are paramount.
Llvarana's reign is characterized by a ruthless pursuit of power, deep-seated vanity, and a desire for balance. Beneath the surface, he embodies the dark desires that fester within the hearts of the [[Fey]], serving as a necessary counterweight as the chaos of [[The Feywild]].
As the ruler of [[BaraDore]]—a floating island cloaked in perpetual black fog—Llvarana governs with an iron fist. The island itself mirrors his power, filled with treacherous landscapes that shift and change, reflecting the unpredictable nature of his rule. His court comprises [[Fomorian]] nobles, each vying for his favor and striving to prove their worth in a realm defined by greed and ambition. While Llvarana's striking appearance commands respect, his governance is marked by cunning manipulation and ruthless power plays, ensuring that none dare challenge him openly.
Every 500 years, during the conjunction of [[The Echo Planes]] when the veil between worlds grows thin, [[The Wild Hunt]] occurs—a barbaric display of primal desires and chaos. While this event is often scorned and deemed unseemly for an [[Archfey]], Llvarana eagerly participates, immersing himself in the bloodshed. He is notorious for capturing mortals and draining their memories, offering them as trophies to his court, showcasing the depths of his ruthlessness and ambition.</pre>

Lord Filvenedore (&quot;The Exalted Black Frost&quot; in [[Elvish]]) is the [[Archfey]] who is [[King|Fey King]] of [[The Winter Court]]. He is also known as The Pale Prince, The Frozen King, and The Lord Of The Winter Heart.  While he is not cruel, he does not carry mercy within his heart. He allies with the other [[Archfey]] only when facing the most dire threats, preferring to deal with his enemies quickly and viciously. He holds mortals and non-Fey in contempt, seeing them as fickle and untrustworthy. Lord Filvenedore does not delight in the merrymaking and adornment of flowers and beauty like his allies. He sees these things as unnecessary, instead focusing his attention on thwarting the [[Fomorians|Fomorian]] from gaining a stronger foothold in his domain, and bringing his wife back from her slumber.

Filvenedore is selfless and proud of his domain and the people of [[The Winter Court]].  He lives in [[Velivelo]] (&quot;The White City&quot; in [[Elvish]]), where he keeps a number of his frozen enemies as ice statues.

His favored servant is his general [[Akut]], a [[White Phoenix]] who serves Filvenedore faithfully.  [[Akut]] is honorable, noble, and valiant and sees those same qualities within his [[King|Fey King]].  They have undying trust within each other and their abilities, and both are loyal to one another.  [[Akut]] is himself a [[King]], and commands all [[Phoenix]] of [[The Feywild]].  While solitary creatures, they would come to his call and fight in his honor.  [[Akut]] and Filenedore have mutual respect for each other and treat each other as equals.

Filvenedore's [[Queen|Fey Queen]] is [[Naurase]] (&quot;The Exulted North Wind&quot; in [[Elvish]]) who countered his harshness with beauty, grace, and calmness.  She slumbers gracefully in a bed of ice, suffering from an unknown illness that holds her in an endless sleep.  It is [[Naurase]] who even in her slumber paints the sky across [[The Echo Planes]] with breathtaking beauty in what is known as [[The Aurora Borealis]].  While the memory has been taken from all, [[Naurase]] is the daughter of [[VanwaHeru]] and aided in his dark plot for [[The Feywild]].  It was the [[Archfey]], including Filvenedore who chose to punish her with endless sleep in [[Sene'Rine'Rada]]; however he did not have the heart to banish her body.

!The Wild Hunt
[[The Wild Hunt]] is the name given to the event that occurs every 500 years when [[The Echo Planes]] are in [[Conjunction|The Conjunction Of The Echo Planes]] and the veil between worlds is thin.  It is a barbaric display of fulfilling base and wanton desires, showcasing the true chaos of the [[Fey]].  While it is often looked down upon and unseemly for a [[Archfey]], Filvenedore and [[Akut]] have joined every hunt since the slumber of his wife [[Naurase]].  While most believe it is wrath and sorrow that drives him, it is [[Akut]] and Filvenedore who seek a cure for his wife using the power of mortal blood.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/the-feywild/archfey/orane.jpg]]

Lord Orane (&quot;The Exalted Hunter&quot; in [[Elvish]]) is a strong, quiet and steadfast [[Archfey]].  He is the [[King|Fey King]] of [[The Spring Court]], and unmatched as a hunter and woodland warrior.  It was Lord Orane who crafted the city of [[Senaliesse]] as a symbol of his love for [[Lady Kalamantri]].  He often acts in tandem with her when [[The Court Of Stars]] is in session.

Lord Orane is kind and majestic, quiet and contemplative - however when provoked he is quick to act.  Many compare his demeanor to that of a lion.  He has gathered a tremendous amount of respect from his people and the other [[Archfey]], who value his council and wisdom.  He has the unwavering loyalty of [[Treants|Treant]], [[Dryads|Dryad]], and [[Nymphs|Nymph]] within his kingdom. 

!Fey Of The People
More than any other [[Archfey]], Lord Orane dedicates himself to his subjects, and is attuned to each and every individual within his care.  He is constantly traveling and patrolling his realm, seeing to it's meticulous safety and upkeep, and he enjoys making genuine connections with every branch and bough; he is very loved by the citizens of [[The Spring Court]].  It is difficult to enter his domain without his personal knowledge, and it is common for Lord Orane to personally greet new visitors upon first stepping foot within his realm.  He shows fondness towards mortals who stumble into [[The Feywild]], and is known to guide them or offer them sanctuary before helping them on their way.

!A Giver Of Gifts
Contrary to [[Fey]] custom, Lord Orane does not strictly hold himself to some of the ideals of the [[Fey]].  For example, he rarely expects gifts to be repaid in kind, and generously offers his time and resources as a token of love and appreciation.  He famously gifted the city of [[Senaliesse]] to [[Lady Kalamantri]], and is known to provide gifts of service to his subjects as he travels his land.

!Steward Of Goll
When a [[Fomorian]] attack penetrated into [[The Court Of Stars]], it was Lord Orane who met them in battle.  He showed them no mercy, defending the realms with no remorse.  He felt conflicted when a lone [[Fomorian]] child lay defenseless on the battlefield.  Lord Orane felt in that moment the same need to protect the unprotected as he did with his own subjects.  At the disdain from the other courts, Lord Orane took the child as his own to raise; wishing to prove that a heart of a [[Fomorian]] can also show love and compassion if they are properly raised.  This child, named [[Goll]], was cursed by [[Lord Filvenedore]] such that if [[Goll]] did not perform an act of true selfless love by his 18th year, his life was forfeit.

Lord Orane places much faith and trust in [[Goll]], more than most feel is wise.  His people are wary of [[Goll]], but reluctantly trust their lord's judgement; and would never think of going against his pleasure.  While Lord Orane is often otherwise occupied within his realm, he places the orchestration of [[The Spring Court]] in [[Goll's|Goll]] hands, with the assistance of his capable advisor, [[Greyhusk]], an ancient [[Ent]] who is a paragon of patience and structure.</pre>

It was Lucian who would commune frequently with [[Raime Wesewierë]], one of her most devout followers.  It was through her teachings that Raime resisted the temptation of [[Zezebazum]] allowing [[The Eternal Cycle]] to continue.

She frequently quarrels with her brother [[Qualok]] and father [[Umwe]] as their unwavering patience unnerves her.  Through inaction they allow injustice to fester.  This impulsive urge to set the world to order causes her to be one of the most meddling [[Gods|The Gods]] in mortal life.  It was Lucian, combined with her brothers [[Kombar]] and [[Xander]], who imprisoned [[Azarad-Ji]] after his vicious murder of [[Valouria]].

It was [[Lucian]] who was sent to subdue [[Azarad-Ji]] once more during [[The Second Age]] with [[The Spire Of Planes]].  It was [[ImoMahtara]], a foot soldier [[AstraKashira]] that struck the final blow for the battle and used [[The Spire Of Planes]] to vanquish [[Drelmor]].</pre>

}}}

The Lysathira (&quot;The Art Of Tea&quot; in [[Elvish]]) is an [[Elvish|Elf]] tradition steeped in history, dating from [[The Third Age]] of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  It is a ceremonial way of preparing and drinking tea.  Beyond just serving and receiving tea, one of the main purposes of the tea ceremony is for guests to enjoy the hospitality of the host in an atmosphere distinct from the stress of everyday life.

The theology of tea dictates that the enjoyment of tea is not a solo act.  The full enjoyment of a tea requires the sharing of one's inner most feelings; it is more important to listen and find deeper meanings within the tea, and therefore [[The Mother|Valouria]].

Maekhar Dezhul, The Lord Of Ghosts, the Darkheart, Champion of [[The Battle Of Ish]], ended his mortal life over 2,000 years ago in a ritual to [[Urdlen]].  During this ritual, he became a [[Lich]], an undying creature capable of great [[Magic]] and power.  He resides deep within [[The Elvish Lands]], far from [[Human]] civilization in a dark swamp known as [[The Whispering Bog]].  Here, he conducts research on topics that amuse him such as the nature of [[The Abyss]] and [[The Eternal Cycle]].

He was one of [[The First Men]] of [[Kellos]], a group of [[Humans|Human]] that emerged in the region after the fall of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  Not much is known about his mortal life, other than he must have had a natural connection to [[Magic]].

<div title="Mages In Society" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="201308041336" modified="201308041339" changecount="2">
<pre>Although magic is not a staple of everyday life for most of the people of [[Asha]], it is not considered uncommon.  No one expects to see a mad sorceress running down the streets throwing fireballs, but maybe the local doctor is a wizard with lots of healing spells.  Most mages live relatively normal lives as teachers, entertainers or country “hedge wizards”.  There are a few who go out and get themselves caught up in adventures, become mercenaries or join militias.   Some enter into politics, as many are wealthy with high status. But that is uncommon because mages simply love the study and practice of their art.  And being that it is quite easy for a mage to make a living just about anywhere he goes just by performing magic (either for entertainment or service), most choose to stay in one place, sometimes never venturing far from home.

This is not to say that all mages are lily white with honest intentions, when wizards do get out of line it tends to be taken very seriously.  When magic is used to harm the innocent, or magical experimentation brings about disaster for a town: people get upset.  When a wizard creates problems with his magic (whether its accidental or not) that gets causes trouble in a town, the city guard will come after that wizard (if the lynch mob doesn’t get him first) right after they repair the damage.

In ages past, [[Cyril Viridian]] outlawed the use [[Magic]] and mages were hunted and killed in a war known as [[Azutan Nagyos]].  Since then, the law was amended and mages have once again come out into the open and have been productive members of society.  There are those who still harbor the historical [[Intolerance For Magic]], but those people are rare and far between - or keep their mouth shut.

To sum it up very simply, mages can fit into almost any aspect of society.  Common folk think of magic as a great skill that’s hard to learn and can do a lot of great things.  People won’t expect to see a mage every day but won’t be shocked or terrified when they do.  Most wizards are considered pleasant and the bad apples don’t ruin the bunch.</pre>

There are three known sources of magic: [[Mana]], [[Spirit]], and [[Primordial|Primordial Magic]].  [[Mana]] fuels the [[Arcane]] spellcasting of [[Wizardry]] and [[Sorcery]].  [[Spirit]] is the source of [[Primal Magic|Primal Magic]] and [[Blood Magic]], and [[Primordial Magic]] can be harnessed by [[The Elder Gods]] or other powerful, immortal beings - as well as some [[Skalds|Skald]] who have begun to tap into the powers that created the universe.

Magnus Zizorum (985 [[AAP]] - Current) is a [[Sorcerer|Sorcery]] and [[Warlock]] who operates within the region of [[The Stone Lands]] in [[The Viridian Empire]].  Bald and aged, Magnus is nonetheless a physically impressive man made all the more powerful-seeming by his considerable charisma, commanding voice, and determined manner.  While he rarely looks relaxed or at ease, he occasionally flashes an amused smile or more often a sneer.  His is equally powerful in both [[Sorcery]] and [[Blood Magic]], which shows upon his body; his eyes are red and bloodshot, and his skin grey and covered with dark black veins.  Often he uses incantations to hide this appearance, due to his vanity.

Magnus is driven and has little time for what he deems to be unimportant and insignificant such as politics.  He will stop at nothing in order to achieve his goals and get what he desires.  He sides with [[Azarad-Ji]] and [[Desecration]], not as a fanatic zealot but as a self proclaimed realist.  He sees the endgame in which the forces of [[Desecration]] need only succeed once, and defending the world from destruction can grow intensely tiring.  It's logic which makes him want to ensure there is a place of power for him when the world crumbles.

It was Magnus that used [[Blood Magic]] to restore the eyesight of [[Desini Orosco]] in order to curry favor with her and her younger sister, whom he was attempting to recruit in the backwater village of [[Wayfaire]].  The two girls ran off with him into his lair in the mountains, where it was the younger sister [[Lyla Orosco]] who first fell victim to his charms.  The two had a baby together, [[Erik Orosco|Erik Doorhaus]].  Magnus's plan all along was to use this baby as a sacrifice in a [[Blood Magic]] ritual to [[Urdlen]] in order to achieve immortality.  He failed due to the heroics of [[Desini Orosco]], who absconded with the baby never to return.  [[Lyla|Lyla Orosco]] unfortunately died in the ritual.

Desini sought [[The Grey Companions]] in the city of [[Brand]] for help.  They tracked down Magnus and killed him in 1009 [[AAP]], only for Magnus to mysteriously reappear in 1020 [[AAP]] and trap and kill [[The Grey Companions]] [[Rog]], [[Dargay Earthhammer]], [[Malden Bray]], [[Chandi]], and [[Sanders]] in a rift to [[The Shadowfell]] the village of [[Abermaw]].

Magnus has a second son [[Malochai Zizorum]] who appears to be a twin of his son [[Erik|Erik Doorhaus]].  His origin is a mystery.

In a confrontation with [[Desini Orosco]], Magnus was subdued and fitted with an [[Enchanted|Enchantment]] collar which prevents the wearer from using [[Sorcery|Sorcery]] and [[Wizardry]]; however he escaped with a flourish of [[Blood Magic]] and remains at large.</pre>

Despite council against it from [[The Seven]], [[Shalekasha]] took it upon herself to tip the scales of justice in favor of [[Lucian's Children|Draugaira]].  While the members of [[The Seven]] acquiesced to her leadership, it was Malthael who attempted to stop her from her rash actions, and persuade her to return to [[Elysium]].  Malthael understood that both the [[Elves|Elf]] and [[Humans|Human]] were favored by [[Lucian]], therefore both required the protection of [[The Seven]].
Malthael argued that while [[Blood Magic]] in itself leads to corruption, those that wield it are not inherently evil.  They are like children, ignorant of the power they wield and the severity of the eternal consequences.  Specifically the [[Humans|Human]] are insatiably curious, and should not be blamed for their experimentation.  He argued that if any blame should be placed, it should be at the feet of [[Azarad-Ji]].  Focus should be placed on winning [[The Eternal Conflict]], only then will [[Lucian]] return and create a lasting peace on [[Asha]].
Malthael was dismayed when [[Shalekasha]] fell to darkness, taking on the mantle of [[Archdevil]] ruling over [[The Circle Of Pride|Avernus]]; becoming the very thing she swore to destroy.  While even [[Auriel]] saw no hope in redeeming [[Shalekasha]], it was Malthael who visited her in [[Avernus]].  He begged for her to atone and return to her position in [[The Seven]].  Angry and hurt from being banished from [[Elysium]], [[Shalekasha]] in a blind outrage banished [[Malthael]] from [[Baator]].  He was pushed with incredible force out of [[Avernus]] and his wings cursed to have never ending pain when attempting to fly.  He has chosen not to fly since, and refuses to speak or give guidance to his fellow [[AstraKashira]] or sing in [[The Heavenly Chorus]] since [[Shalekasha's|Shalekasha]] fall from grace.

!Longing For Lucian's Wisdom
It was Malthael who was most saddened by [[Lucian]] and [[The Elysians|Elysian]] leaving and locking themselves behind [[The Divine Gate]].  He desperately craves the wisdom and guidance of [[Lucian]], to reaffirm the mission and purpose of the [[AstraKashira]] and of [[The Seven]].  He understands that a great divide exists within [[Elysium]], one that causes the [[Souls|Soul]] of [[Elysium]] to be restless.  The warmth [[Lucian]] provides from behind [[The Divine Gate]] pales in comparison to her loving embrace, and he knows [[Lucian]] longs for his guidance as much as he needs hers.

!Guider Of Souls
Malthael guides the [[Souls|Soul]] of pure of heart mortals to an afterlife in [[Elysium]] and [[Elves|Elf]] to [[The Fields Of Kalara]] in [[The Feywild]].  While [[Elves|Elf]] typically remain quiet on the solemn journey, sure of their place in [[The Eternal Cycle]], mortal creatures such as [[Humans|Human]] often feel a disconnected discontent and require more of his guidance.  Even the most devout mortal can be confused, doubtful, and full of fear.  It is these journeys Malthael cherishes most, for the light in their eyes and peace in their [[Soul|Soul]] upon first seeing [[Elysium]] makes him feel more connected to [[Lucian]].</pre>

Martin Blackbriar was the official head of [[House Blackbriar]] and [[Shield]] of [[Duskstone]].  Martin was a master [[Vampire]], slain by [[Desini Orosco]] and [[Minerva Carrington]] of [[The Grey Companions]] in 1021 [[AAP]].  He was of unknown age, and was known to assume the identity of a &quot;son&quot; whom was often an abducted boy.  In 1021 [[AAP]] he was masquerading as Lord Martin Blackbriar IV.

He was tall, strong and statuesque.  His black hair framed his chiseled, handsome face - which was adorned with a well groomed goatee.  After orchestrating a plot to gain more prestige for his house in [[The Siege Of Derby]], he forced [[Derya Carrington]] into a marriage against her will and &quot;adopted&quot; [[Frederick Carrington]] as his son.  [[Derya|Derya Carrington]] was miserable as the object of affection for this creature - having lost her loving husband and [[House]].  She threw herself from the top of the tower, and died.  Martin was truly enamored by her beauty, and likewise fell in love with [[Minerva Carrington]] when she wandered upon his doorstep in 1021 [[AAP]].</pre>

Melaniacha'hogga is a form of ritual combat practiced by the [[Variona'Sha]].

The [[Variona'Sha]] never fight amongst themselves.  Instead they practice Melaniacha’hogga, which is a six on six battle of ritualistic combat.  The two [[clans|Variona'Sha Clans]] in dispute square off in a no holds barred competition.

One of the [[Variona'Sha]] is chosen as the team Dostanna, or leader.  The Dostanna must wear a necklace with the symbol of their [[clan|Variona'Sha Clans]].  If this necklace is removed by the opposing team, the Dostanna and his team are considered defeated.  All combatants must remove any armor before the competition, and only weapons without an edge or point are admitted.  Missile weapons are allowed, but frowned upon and considered taboo.

An annual competition is held, and all [[clans|Variona'Sha Clans]] attend.  The winning [[clan|Variona'Sha Clans]] gains a [[leading voice|Chief Of Chiefs]] over the actions of all of the remaining tribes.  This competition is entitled ‘[[The Rite Of Sha]]’.

[[The Humans|Human]] have their own version of this tournament combat that they call [[Akhogga]].  The rules and intent are extremely different, however.</pre>

The Merrow are undersea merfolk who terrorize the waters of [[Asha]].  They live far beneath the ocean floor in search for one things: food.  They lack empathy, and are driven by primal instinct.

The Mezmer Eel is a species found native to the waters of [[Lake Mistmoor]] in central [[Kellos]].  They are unique to the lake due to the trace amounts of [[Residiuum]] found in the water.  They are predators who emit a psychic pulse to hypnotize their prey before burrowing into their skin to feed and reproduce.  They are small, growing roughly a foot long; but have enough power to take down a humanoid if caught unaware.

They are hard to kill, being able to regenerate from missing parts.  Cutting one in half mysteriously just creates two Mezmer's.  The fishermen of [[The Fisher's League]] burn them on sight, wishing to eradicate this nuisance creature from [[The Lake|Lake Mistmoor]] altogether.

!Swarms
The Mezmer population comes and goes in cycles.  Sometimes 5, 10, or even 15 year cycles depending on the brood.  When the population of Mezmer in [[Lake Mistmoor]] grows too large, they change their behavior and habits from a solitary to a gregarious swarming creature.  This swarming behavior is a response to overcrowding.</pre>

Milkfish are not really fish at all.  They are large mammals which live in shallow and sandy places along seashores, grazing on seaweed.  They have squat ugly faces covered with whiskers, thick, bony front limbs used for digging and balancing themselves in the water, and long lumpy bodies which end in a flat whale-like tail.  The hide is tough and leathery, with thick blubber underneath.  Their only attack is an ineffectual tail-slap.

They are extremely easy to domesticate, Enterprising herders have found that in addition to the rich milk that gives the animals their name, milkfish meat is tender and tasty, and the fatty layer underneath the tough outer skin can be used to make useful oils.

Mimics are strange predators that assume the form of mundane objects in order to attract prey.  In urban settings, they have adapted to take the shape of doors, chests, and other objects likely to be touched.  Their skin texture and color can change to almost perfectly resemble wood, stone, metal, and other basic materials; although the natural state of a mimic's skin is a rough speckled grey similar to granite.

!Behavior
Mimics have simple minds, and are singly focused on acquiring food.  Although they show minor intelligence in their ability to ambush prey, they lack higher brain functions that are used for complex communication and socialization.  Mimics are capable of altering the pigmentation and texture of their skins by pumping a pigmented fluid from internal muscular organs through surface capillary vessels.  They see through light-sensative sensors on their skin, allowing them to detect heat out to a great distance.</pre>

//Meet my royal subjects! ''- Minerva Carrington''//
}}}
Minerva (c. 1003 [[AAP]] to Current) was a player character run by [[Elizabeth Disbrow]]

Minerva grew up in what is affectionately called [[The Warrens]] in the city of [[Brand]].  [[The Warrens]] are the cramped, dirty slums of the city located near the lower docks.  Filthy and poor, Minerva lived off of the scraps left by the rich merchants and caravans moving goods through the ports of the city.

She eventually joined up with a few upstart treasure hunters, which included her childhood friends [[Drold Lorin]] (a [[Darkling]]) and [[Lommy Loamfoot]] (a [[Bairn]]) as well as Drold's cousin.  She found herself exploring subterranean tombs and ruins for bits of leftover treasure.  This life suited her well, until betrayed by [[Drold Lorin]] and his cousin - ending in the death of her good friend [[Lommy Loamfoot]].  She carries with her a pair of ornate daggers, relics from [[The Sylvan Empire]], found on the adventure in which her friend died.

Minerva stayed in the city of [[Brand]], helping those less fortunate than herself.  She became known as &quot;The Red Queen&quot; - a vigilante for hire.  Later she met up with [[Erik Doorhaus]] and [[Desini Orosco]], and joined [[The Grey Companions]] in 1009 [[AAP]].

She later learned she was a member of [[House Carrington]] and was rescued at birth when her family was murdered in a take over plot of [[Hagen]] during [[The Siege Of Derby]].</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/bestiary/famous/minuka.jpg]]
Minuka (&quot;First To Dance&quot;) in [[Elvish]] was an [[Elf]] turned [[Banshee]] in [[The Third Age]].  She was an accomplished [[Wizard|Wizardry]] who experimented and studied with new forms of [[Enchantment]].  She gave birth to a daughter named [[Namarie 'Eithla]] (&quot;Farewell to Spring&quot;) who was an [[Achasiono]] who did not possess the magical aptitude innate to an [[Elf]]; causing her to be banished from [[The Sylvan Empire]].  While the [[Elven People|The Sylvan Empire]] saw [[Namarie 'Eithla]] as disgraced and unnatural, Minuka could not leave her child to be exiled alone.  To her family's astonishment, Minuka willingly went into exile with her daughter.

The duo traveled beyond the lands of the [[Elves|Elf]], finding themselves in the untamed lands of what is now northern [[Kellos]].  She built a simple home in the wilderness, far from prying eyes.  There they both lived in peace, finding their own way to heed the words of [[The Mother|Valouria]].  Minuka taught [[Namarie 'Eithla]] many things, and they were content with their simple lives.  Decades passed, and to their surprise they eventually caught a small [[Human]] boy trespassing through their wood.  This boy was named [[Valamer]], and was exiled from his [[tribe|The First Men]] due to his uncontrollable and dangerous [[Wild Magic Surges|Sorcery]].  Taking pity on the boy, Minuka gave him shelter, food, and taught him how to control his surges.  Years passed, and the boy grey into a man; and [[Valamer]] returned to his tribe powerful with [[Sorcery]].

He later returned with a tribe of primitive [[Humans|Human]].  [[Valamer]] wished for his tribe, which he called [[Rhûn]] to settle around Minuka's home.  Years passed and the tribe became a small village.  Minuka did her best to council the tribe, but quickly found their greed and ambition more than she could control.  The [[Humans|Human]] saw power in having her and her daughter within their tribe, using their knowledge to gain an advantage against their rivals.  The tribe kept their two [[Elves|Elf]] secret, and became reliant on them.

Minuka, seeing their wicked ways, refused to help anymore - and began to leave.  Enraged, [[Valamer]] took [[Namarie 'Eithla]] hostage, forcing Minuka to stay and continue to provide the tribe power.  Minuka pleaded with [[Valamer]], whom she had once come to see as a son; but her was unmoved.  In an uncharacteristic show of wrath and malice, Minuka used every ounce of power she had at her disposal to destroy the entire village in order to save her daughter.  A fierce battle ensued, and while she suffered a mortal wound, she saw to it that all of the tribesmen were slaughtered.  In the rubble, she was stricken with grief when she saw her daughter's crumpled body.

Feeling the life drain from her, she did not feel the longing for [[The Fields Of Kalara]] - instead she felt an intense rage and sorrow that anchored her to [[The Material Plane]].  She could not allow herself to move on, convinced that her daughter would not be waiting there for her due to her being an [[Achasiono]].  She transformed into a [[Banshee]] which haunted the ruins of [[Rhûn]] for eternity.

In 1026 [[AAP]], [[ElethaNori]] (&quot;Mother's Gift&quot; in [[Elvish]]) and a group of adventurers encountered Minuka.  After an intense encounter, [[ElethaNori]] was able to help Minuka find closure and convince her that [[Namarie 'Eithla]] was in fact waiting for her in [[The Fields Of Kalara]].  Minuka, with tears running down her face - finally was able to let go, fading away.</pre>

<pre>Mordayn Vapor is a drug made of roughly ground leaves of a rare herb found in deep forests, Mordayn is so potent that it is taken by steeping a small amount in hot water and then inhaling the vapors of the resultant tea.  Raw Mordayn powder and Mordayn-tainted water are deadly poison; taking the powder directly or drinking the water produces an immediate overdose.  It is renowned for the beautiful visions it induces and the deadly peril of its sinister embrace.

''Initial Effect:'' Exotic visions of incredible beauty enthrall the user for the next d20+10 minutes.  During this time the user must make a Wisdom save of 12 or lose any action they attempt.
''Side Effect:'' The visions are incredibly beautiful and poignant.  The user's normal life seems drab an futile in comparison, and they ache to experience the transcendent beauty of the drug-induced dreams again.  When the dose wears off, the user must make a Wisdom save of DC 17 or fall under a compulsion to do whatever is necessary to repeat another dose (treat as a compulsion similar to that of the suggestion spell).  This compulsion lasts for 1d4 hours before fading.
''Overdose:'' If two doses are taken within the space of an hour, or if raw Mordayn Powder or Mordayn Tea are ingested, the drug is a deadly poison (ingested DC 17, 2d10 damage).  Mordayn vapod addicts often throw out the tea as soon as they inhale and make sure that only one dose is available at a time in order to make sure they cannot overdose on the deadly drug.</pre>

!Introduction
The Mordmarr'Khan (translated from [[Dwarvish]] as &quot;The Undermountain Papacy&quot;) is one of the oldest religious institutions in the world.  It plays a prominent role in all [[Dwarf]] [[Strongholds|Stronghold]] and politics.  The Papacy worships [[Kombar]], the patron of the [[Kombar'Ran]], and is headed by the [[Horm'Kestaz]] or &quot;Supreme Holy&quot;, who has supreme power over the church.

The tenets of the church are from [[Kombar]] himself, and impose an order and purpose to the [[Dwarvish|Dwarf]] people.

At age 15, a select group of [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] children become wards of the church, and are given the title of [[Volg'gogan]] or &quot;Stone Blessed&quot;.  They are seen as a deadly contingent of a [[Stronghold's|Stronghold]] defense - possessing both might and [[Magic]].  They are blessed with the [[Divine Favor]] of [[Kombar]].

!Doctrine
Papacy doctrine has developed over the centuries, reflecting an amalgam of ancient teachings and modern sensibilities.  The church believes that it is continually guided by [[Kombar]] and is therefore infallible from error when a firm decision is reached.  Doctrine is documented in a tome called the [[Var'Valaszok]] or &quot;Eternal Answers&quot;.
Twelve virtues were handed by [[Kombar]] to the first [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], said to be his commandments to his children: Temperance, Charity, Clarity, Community, Duty, Honor, Justice, Courage, Ambition, Endurance, Wisdom, Mercy.

!Beliefs
* Kombar forged [[Asha]], and the prison that holds [[Azarad-Ji]]
* It is believed that the first [[Stronghold]] was built by [[Kombar]] himself.  [[Kombar's Lost Stronghold]] is now lost to history.
* When a [[Dwarf]] dies, he becomes a warrior of [[Kombar]].  This is called being &quot;[[returned to the stone|Return To The Stone]]&quot;.

!The Iron Tabernacle
[[The Iron Tabernacle]] in the [[Stronghold]] of [[Avorbarath]] is the central religious structure for the Mordmarr'Khan.  There is housed [[The Hammer Of Devotion]], [[Kombar's|Kombar]] hammer - gifted to the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] upon their awakening.</pre>

Mother Pidna is the name of the ancient entity that commands the small criminal gang in [[The Lower Streap]] of [[Tszanthus]] called [[The Little Lambs]].  She calls the uppermost layer of [[The Undercity]] her home, affectionately called The Burrows.  Her colossal centipedal form possesses hundreds of limbs, each eerily reminiscent of the hands of children.  She adorns these hands with pilfered jewelry and trinkets, causing each of her movements to be a cacophony of clinking metal.  Along her carapace are scales that resemble a grotesque mosaic of humanoid visages.  This macabre embellishment appears to be a form of camouflage.  Her size and shape allow her to move with surprising speed and agility through the network of subterranean passages beneath the city, where she resides.  Her lair is situated in a dark, circular pit.  Her lair served as both a refuge and a headquarters for [[The Little Lambs]].

As the matriarch of [[The Little Lambs]], Mother Pidna displays a blend of maternal instinct and criminal acumen, creating a twisted yet effective hierarchy within the gang.  The children view her with a mixture of awe and fear, recognizing her as both protector and enforcer.

Her origin is unclear, however she professes to be old and has extensive knowledge amassed over [[Ages|History]].  She claims to have witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations from beneath the city streets.  She never ventures beyond the confines of her lair, and does not take kindly to unexpected visitors who don't show her the proper respect or bring gifts.

When the children of [[The Little Lambs]] reach a certain age, Mother Pidna enacts a chilling and enigmatic process known to nobody else; and they are never seen again.  Some suggest that these individuals undergo a metamorphosis, undergoing a ghastly change to becomes one of the many scales on her carapace that resemble a face.  Others claim that these former members become caretakers or guardians within her dark lair, their loyalty repurposed in an eerie symbiosis with the ancient creature.  Mother Pidna simply responds that they have been set free.</pre>

Mysara (46 [[IO]] to 29 [[AAP]]) was a prodigious user of [[Magic]] and a scholar of [[The Planes Of Existence]].  Although few details of her life are known, she is regarded as the first [[Human]] to explore [[Sene'Rine'Rada]], [[The Shadowfell]], and [[The Astral Stream]].  She documented her work in a manual she dubbed the [[Codex Of The Infinite Planes]], still thought to be one of the most thorough examinations of other worlds.  She postulated the existence of dimensions beyond [[The Material Plane]] that she never was able to make contact with - many of which have been discovered since.  She was known as the Lady of Shadowy Depths.

She called the area now known as [[The Dales]] her home, and saw to the safety and well being of its inhabitants.  When the wizard [[Armondax]] battled the [[Dragon]] [[Culdranth]] and caused the destruction of at least two hamlets and a city, Mysara stepped in.  This resulted in the beginning of a long running feud between two of the most powerful mages in the world.  Mysara found that [[Armondax]] was reckless and dangerous in his exploration of [[Magic]].

When [[The Demon Plague]] began, Mysara sought out [[Armondax]] believing him responsible for the death and destruction occurring to the people under her care.  After a brief but powerful exchange of magical combat, the two realized a darker magic was to blame.  Together they combined their magical talents to battle the cult known as [[The Holy Scourge]].  After a series of conflicts, they sent word to both [[Fazar]] and [[Waywill]], two equally powerful mages - and together the four of them brought an end to [[The Demon Plague]].

While the group managed to avert an impending [[Desecration]] locally, [[The Destruction Of Uskard]] saw to a surge of [[Uskardeen]] refugees come to [[Kellos]].  The near destruction at the hands of [[The Holy Scourge]], and inclusion of the magically gifted [[Uskardeen]] saw [[Cyril Viridian]] take power and overthrow [[The Old Republic]].  [[Cyril Viridian]] began the [[Azutan Nagyos]], a war against [[Magic]].  During this time the four mages founded what is now known as [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].  Banded together they fought against [[Cyril Viridian]], self appointed [[Emperor]] of [[Kellos]].  After a few years of fighting, the [[Azutan Nagyos]] ended - and magic was no longer outlawed.

<pre>The [[Ancient Elves|The Sylvan Empire]] perfected a method for multiple spell-casters to join together in order to cast [[Magic]] far beyond what was possible through a single [[Wizard|Wizardry]] or [[Sorcerer|Sorcery]].  These rituals, known as Mythals allowed a team of powerful casters to work together in order to permanently alter [[Mana]] and [[The Weave]].  The completion of a Mythal required the willing sacrifice of one of the casters; a result that would lead to the Mythal being named after them.

Most Mythals are tied to a particular location, bending the rules of [[Magic]] and reality in that place often to protect and defend.  A known [[Mythal]] in [[Asha]] is the [[Glamour]] that surrounds [[The High Forest]] in [[The Elvish Lands]] of [[Kellos]].  This Mythal confuses and disorients those without [[Fey]] blood, making it impossible for them to find the [[Haven|Havens]] of [[Numeneithela]].

The secrets of Mythals are not widely known, and used rarely due to their high cost.  What few Mythals exist can corrode over time if not maintained.  A caster must feed the Mythal regularly to ensure it does not fade or become corrupted from disuse.</pre>

Nabras is a cunning and chaotic [[Spren]] that inhabits [[The Plane Of Existence|The Planes Of Existence]] known as [[Sene'Rine'Rada]].  He is known for his mischievous and childlike playfulness, similar to that of a [[Fey]].  He gained the ability to speak through a deal with the [[Archfey]] [[Lady Velisene]], and in return gifted her with a curved silver sword named [[Starfall]] that he made from a living dream.

Nabras is highly intelligent and often uses his playful demeanor to outmaneuver his opponents.  He is a skilled manipulator and enjoys teasing [[Lady Velisene]] with the knowledge of their deal, despite holding up his end of the bargain of not revealing any details to anyone (including herself).

!The prison of VanwaHeru
The purpose of [[Lady Velisene]] striking a deal with Nabras was to craft a prison for [[VanwaHeru]].  This [[Archfey]] is trapped by Nabras in a prison within [[Sene'Rine'Rada]].</pre>

[[Queen]] Naurase (&quot;The Exalted North Wind&quot; in [[Elvish]]), stands as the current [[Archfey]] [[Queen]] of [[The Winter Court]], where she rules alongside her husband [[Lord Filvenedore]].  She is a [[Feytouched]] turn [[Archfey]], the first of her kind due to her being a product of [[The Quicksilver Program]] run by [[VanwaHeru]].

!Feytouched
Born into the mortal realm, [[Queen]] Naurase was stolen from her mortal parents by [[VanwaHeru]], the ruler of [[The Court Of Stars]].  In her place, a [[Fey]] [[Changeling]] was left in the guise of a baby.  Named and raised as a [[Fey]] child, she dwelled in a glen under the guidance of three [[Hags|Hag]] who taught her the kinship of their [[Coven|Hag Coven]].  Arcane learning came easy to Naurase, however her [[Magic]] was wild and unpredictable, manifesting in bursts that overwhelmed her.  Even the [[Archfey]] [[Babaroga]] was confounded by the power she displayed, unnerved she did not recognize its source.

!The Quicksilver Program
[[VanwaHeru]] recognized her immense power and believed her to be 'the one' he was searching for after more than 10,000 years and countless failed attempts to alter mortal genetic stock with his [[Quicksilver Program|The Quicksilver Program]].  He accelerated her training, adopting her as his daughter and growing her into the first [[Feytouched]] raised to the title of [[Archfey]].
Ascending to the role of [[Princess]] of [[The Court Of Stars]], Naurase faced wary acceptance from [[The Court|The Court Of Stars]] due in part to [[VanwaHeru's|VanwaHeru]] notorious reputation.  Her captivating presence, a blend of beauty and otherworldly power, drew others towards her despite the unsettling nature of her transformation.  Naurase showed equal skill in painting and [[Foretelling]], and expressed her divinations through thick layers of paint, devoting decades to a single work.  Her [[Foretelling]] spoke of [[her father's|VanwaHeru]] downfall, the disillusionment of [[The Court Of Stars]], and her own impending imprisonment.  She was distressed by her visions, and would be overcome with melancholy and grief.

!Fated Love
When Naurase first meet [[Lord Filvenedore]], they were both overcome the emotion that is shared by two [[Souls|Soul]] that were [[Fated]].  This connection surpasses the boundaries of time, and their passion and devotion to each other were the envy of those who longed for such love.  Two [[Souls|Soul]] entwined, they became a symbol of unwavering commitment.  Any who doubted her station as an [[Archfey]] were quickly swayed when [[Lord Filvenedore]] pledged himself to her.  She countered his harshness with beauty, grace and calmness - and was the first to put a smile upon his face.

!The Fall Of The Court Of Stars
When [[The Court Of Stars]] was overthrown, the [[Archfey]] entombed [[VanwaHeru]] and chose to punish Naurase with an endless sleep in [[Sene'Rine'Rada]].  However, [[Lord Filvenedore]] refused to banish her body, and she slumbers in a bed of ice and thought to suffer from an unknown illness.  The restless [[Lord Filvenedore]], unable to recall that it was him who set her into her sleep, seeks to find a cure for her suffering.  He even resorts to offering blood of mortals.

!The Aurora Borealis
Deep within her sleep in [[Sene'Rine'Rada]], Naurase remains in a dream state.  Her consciousness extends into [[The Echo Planes]], where she paints the sky with breathtaking beauty - [[The Aurora Borealis]] - a testament to her enduring strength and the fateful love that binds her to [[Lord Filvenedore]].</pre>

NeneHwesta (&quot;Moon Shadow&quot;) (2122 [[IO]] - present) is the [[Shaman|Variona'Sha Shaman]] of [[The Stag Clan]], one of the clans of the [[Variona'Sha]].  He lives with the clan on the outskirts of [[The High Forest]] within [[The Elvish Lands]] of [[Kellos]].  He is nearly 3,200 years old, born a handful of years after the fall of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  He is the oldest and wisest member of his tribe, advising multiple [[Star Singers|Star Singer]].  He has a daughter named [[ElethaNori]] (&quot;Mother's Gift&quot;) with his wife [[CsaraAsha]] (&quot;To Yearn For Home&quot;), who died in childbirth.  Since her death, NeneHwesta has been more distant and leaving for long periods of time for his spirit journeys; leaving his daughter to be cared for by the tribe.  He seeks his end where he gives his spirit back to [[Valouria]], but has been unable to achieve this due to no new [[Shaman|Variona'Sha]] coming to replace him.

He worries this is due to the fact that when his wife was with child, she died of sudden complications in the birth.  His daughter was premature, and was barely clinging to life.  It was clear that the baby would not survive the night.  In an act of desperation and love, NeneHwesta did the unthinkable by using a portion of his Stag spirit in a [[Blood Magic]] ritual that saved the life of his daughter.  For the ritual, he was required to give his eyes, blinding him forever.  This act greatly wounded him and his connection to his spirit animal; reducing his [[Karma]] and [[Druidic Power|Primal Magic]].  Despite this, he still remains the most powerful [[Druid]] in [[The Elvish Lands]].
 
His spirit animal is [[Iefyra]] (&quot;Patience&quot;), a giant white stag that can always be found nearby.  They are companions that share a [[Soul]], and while NeneHwesta has become more connected to nature, [[Iefyra]] has become more connected to the [[Elves|Elf]] of [[The Stag Clan]].  [[Iefyra]] was protective of [[ElethaNori]] since her birth, caring for her when NeneHwesta would leave.  NeneHwesta has high expectations of his daughter, and was a difficult father due to him being out of touch and distant due to his vast age.  He has expected for her to follow in his footsteps, replacing him as [[Shaman|Variona'Sha Shaman]]; but no [[Faeratha]] (&quot;Spirit Guide&quot;) has yet approached her, much to his dismay.

NeneHwesta is a powerful [[Dream Walker|Dream Walking]] and is an adept explorer of [[Sene'Rine'Rada]].  He uses this talent to keep the [[Shaman|Variona'Sha]] of the various tribes in contact with each other and share news, vital information, and discuss important events.  The power that he wields allows him to manage the balance of all of [[The Echo Planes]], as well as [[Sene'Rine'Rada]]; one of the few [[Druids|Druid]] who can claim this masterful feat.

Nester Arkwood (c. 960 [[AAP]] - 1025 [[AAP]]) was the son of [[Tilden Arkwood]] and [[Cassandra Huntley]], [[Zylokian|Zylok]] [[Arkanus First Class]], [[Distinguished Magus]] of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]], [[Lord Magister]] of [[The Magian Imperium]].  He was the [[Headmaster]] of [[The Athenaeum]], and was known as one of the most powerful wizards in the world.

Wielder of [[The Shard Of Sakkrad]], Nester lists as one of his many achievements the rediscovery of [[Echantment]] and the invention of the [[Arkstones]] which due to [[The Triumph Initiative]] led to the invention of [[Airships|Airship]] in 1021 [[AAP]].

His discovery of [[Enchantment]] was an oddity, as it was jump started due to a time paradox caused by [[Erik Doorhaus]] and the creation of [[The Chrono Ocullum]] in 1023 [[AAP]].  [[The Grey Companions]] were thrust backwards in time, and spoke with Nester Arkwood when he was a teacher at [[The Athenaeum]]; seeding the discovery of [[Enchantment]].

He was slain by [[Harmost Xawn]] and [[Penelope Kensington]] on an attack of [[The Athenaeum]] in an attempt to bring about the resurrection of [[The Whispered One]] known as [[The Black Night]].</pre>

Nicholette is a young shy waif who serves [[The Grey Companions]]. She keeps quiet and to herself, tending to the cleaning and chores needed to keep the manor running. Since hiring her, the floors have been immaculate.

Nicholette was born an orphan, and has a soft spot for young children.  In her spare time, she secretly slips out of the house and makes her way to a local orphanage where she helps care for the children, donating her time and what little money she makes.  She is a creature of habit, and her life is very much routine.  She loves the repetition of waking, cleaning, serving, and working.

She is not comfortable being the focus of attention, and is quite nervous when spoken to directly.  She tugs and twirls her hair when nervous or afraid.  This makes her an awful liar, and she knows it.  The only exception is [[Erik Doorhaus]], whom for some reason she feels very comfortable around.  In part due to his young age, his [[Magic]] affinity, and his creative ideas.  She admires him and even finds him adorable.

Nicolette is naturally curious, and was born with an innate [[Sorcery]].  While her skill in [[Magic]] is very poor, she secretly spies on the classes that young [[Erik Doorhaus]] provides to the local gifted children.  While her curiosity of the secrets held within [[The Grey Companions]] vault are strong, her fear of [[Desini Orosco]] runs deeper.</pre>

Nightgaunts are chaotic creatures of [[Sene'Rine'Rada]], that haunt and stalk dreamers who find themselves helpless in the realm.  They have skin that is slick and rubbery-looking, rather like the skin of a whale.  They do not have faces at all but instead bear blank, unsettling surfaces on the front of their heads.

They are stealthy hunters, perfectly silent even when flying.  Usually, Nightgaunts don't try to kill their victims directly but capture them to feed off of their fear and torment.

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or begin rolling Death Saving Throws, as explained in the following sections.

!Instant Death
Massive damage can kill you instantly.  When damage reduces you to 0 hit point and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.  For example, you have a maximum hit points of 12 and a current hit points of 6.  If you take 18 damage from an attack, you are reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains.  Because the remaining damage equals your hit point maximum, you die.

!Death Saving Throws
Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw called a Death Saving Throw to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang on to life.  Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.Roll a d20.  If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed.  Otherwise, you fail.  A failure results in you acquiring the Disabled condition (see below).  On your third success, you become Stable (see below).  Each failure results in a new condition until your third failure, where you die.  The success and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.  The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable

!Dying Conditions
Death conditions alter your capabilities in a variety of ways, and continue to worsen if you are not healed or stabilized.

''Disabled'' //NO FAILED DEATH SAVES//
You drop whatever you are holding and fall prone.Your may take no actions, bonus action or reactions and your only movement option is to crawl at a speed of 5 feet.Attack rolls against you have advantage.  You automatically fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

''Holding On'' //ONE FAILED DEATH SAVE//
You are incredibly weakened.  You can no longer crawl, and even talking is becoming challenging as you hold on to consciousness.  You can only speak one or two words at a time.

''On Death's Door'' //TWO FAILED DEATH SAVES//
You are unconscious and incapacitated, unaware of your surroundings.

''Stable'' //THREE SUCCESSFUL DEATH SAVES//
You are Unconscious.  Every hour, you must roll a Constitution Saving Throw (DC 10 + 1 per hour after the first) to remain stable.  If you fail the save, you again are dying and in the Holding On condition with a failed death save.

''Dead'' //THREE FAILED DEATH SAVES//
You are dead, and your [[Soul]] immediately departs your body; getting the [[Soul]] back requires access to [[powerful magic|Resurrection Magic]]</pre>

Numeneithela (&quot;Endless Spring&quot; in [[Elvish]]) is an [[Elvish|Elf]] [[Haven|Havens]] located deep within [[The High Forest]] in [[The Elvish Lands]] of [[Kellos]].  Located 
near a string of mountains known as [[The Star Mounts]], it was first settled by the [[Forana'loloKashira]] soon after the start of [[The Fourth Age]].  It was they that enriched the land, creating the [[Mythal]] that blesses [[The High Forest]] with eternal spring and autumn as well as protects Numeneithela from being found by outsiders.

Nymphs are native to [[The Feywilds]], entities of great beauty that personify different aspects of nature, with their life force and their very appearance being linked to a specific physical location in which they are bound.  They make up a class of [[Fey]] known as [[The Shy Folk]], often living solitary lives.  Their domain is places deeply tied to nature, wild places untouched by civilization.  Many consider the Nymphs to be the most wild and capricious of the [[Fey]].

Something that all nymphs often share is their stunning beauty, which they can use to develop defensive abilities.  Those who gaze at them without permission can end up blinded, or worse.

!Types Of Nymphs
''Dryads'' -  nymphs bound to forests, particular sections of the woods, or individual trees and other forms of plant life.
''Nereids'' - nymphs bound to the sea or smaller bodies of water such as rivers, pools and lakes. 
''Oreads'' - nymphs bound to mountains and rocks.</pre>

|![[Click Here For Information on the Orcish Language|Black Speech]]|

Orcs are squat, green skinned humanoids. Orcs have broad noses, pallid eyes, and broad mouths dominated by enlarged canine teeth.  Most Orcs stand about 5 ½ feet tall (height is 2” less on average than a [[Human]], weight is10 pounds heavier).  Their arms are long and powerful, their legs are bowed, and their hands and feet are broad and coarse.  Their skin is dark with a leathery texture.  Hair colors other than black are very rare.

!Search, Destroy, Repeat
Orcs conquer and take whatever they desire, even from one another.  They are built for survival in even the harshest of environments.  The only thing preventing the Orcs from taking over the world is their cultural inability to cooperate with or even tolerate others (including themselves).  Orcs are fearless fighters, every adult Orc knows how to battle with weapons.  Orcs believe that the world is intrinsically hostile, and that the only thing an individual can do is grab as much as he can while he’s alive and kill anything that tries to take it away from him.  Many Orcs are pathologically paranoid.

!Colors of Conquest
Orcs do not have any appreciation for esoteric or craft skills (unless they have to do with combat).  They do not understand or love beauty or art.  They do however decorate their surroundings with crude symbols of ownership or religion.  Three colors have special meaning to all orcs, and they adorn their bodies, possessions and lairs with pigments that produce these hues.  Red ochre is used to represent blood, grayish white ash to represent death, and charcoal to represent darkness.

!The Strongest and Most Cunning Lead
Orcs are very social creatures.  They gather in [[large tribes|Orcish Tribes]] and nations, but remain highly unorganized.  Their social structure is founded on strength, and the strongest tribe member leads.  No Orc has any rights, only privileges he has fought for.  Since the males are stronger, the females are usually abused.  Life is very hard for Orcish women.  Orcs revel in slavery.  They have subjugated the [[Troll]] race, but also have slaves of other races (including their own).  When two [[Orcish Tribes]] battle, the victor takes all surviving prisoners as slaves.  It must be said that life within an [[Orcish Tribe]] is a difficult power struggle.  Tribal members constantly attempt to undermine those of higher status, so that they themselves may personally acquire higher social standing.

!Cast Iron Stomach
Orcs have the ability to eat almost anything (gristle, spoiled milk, mildewed grain, half-rotten vegetables, fuzzy blue-green meat) as long as it's organic.  They also have the ability to distinguish between (and recognize) individuals, places and things by their odors.  Their sense of smell is far beyond the [[Human]] norm, and can determine distinctive odors for practically everything and anything they may encounter.  They may memorize an odor by sniffing it for at least one minute and making a successful Intelligence roll of DC 11.

!Omens and Superstitions
The Orcs have an affinity to [[Azarad-Ji]] and have adopted the language of [[Black Speech]], shared with the [[Dathairä]].  It is spoken from deep within the throat, making speech sound like guttural grunts and croaks.  Each tribe has a unique dialect, making communication between tribes difficult and troublesome.  When an Orc becomes skilled with a talent for [[Blood Magic]], they are given the respect and title of tribe [[Shaman|Orc Shaman]].  Only one [[Orc Shaman]] may exist for a tribe, so a [[shaman|Orc Shaman]] is expected to kill any potential rivals, or leave the tribe.  Solitary shamans are not uncommon, but they often dedicate their measly lives to plotting the death of a rival so they may rejoin a tribe.

The lands to the south of the ‘civilized’ portions of Asha are known as the Orcish Lands.  This harsh rugged terrain is hospitable only to the Orcs that thrive there.  [[Orcish Tribes]] have carved a pitiful excuse for civilization in a land full of quagmires, active volcanoes, and thick dense jungles.  [[Orcs|Orc]] have a unique physiology that allows them to sustain their bodies with food that is barely digestible by other races.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/orpheous.jpg]]

Orpheous (c:1004 [[AAP]] - current), twin to his brother [[Azarad]] (&quot;Ozzy&quot;) was born in the sprawling and often unforgiving district of [[The Lower Streap]] in the city of [[Tszanthus]] on the continent of [[Ruje]].  He and his brother found peace in the diversity of cultures, and lived in poverty in their youth - instilling a sense of resilience.  Raised by a single mother, who died young - Orpheous cared for his sickly brother [[Azarad]] and learned the ways of survival at an early age.  The streets taught him the value of strength, but it was his mother who instilled in him the principles of loyalty and kindness.

It was clear that Orpheous was unlike other children.  He was stronger and more alluring than most, traits that served him well in the harsh environments of [[The Lower Streap]].  It was during one of [[Ozzy's|Azarad]] boughts of sickness where Orpheous first understood he was different.  He learned he was an [[Aasimar]] and used his healing hands to calm his brother.

!The Storm Within
As two children on the streets, Orpheous knew that his brother was struggling to survive and had limited time left.  He sought anyone who would help, but many turned them away.  [[The Medica]] only would tend to those with money and [[The Church Of Final Atonement]] turned them away due to their lack of faith.  It was an [[Acolyte]] of [[The Church Of Final Atonement]] who witnessed the two boys being turned away who took them in.  [[Aroden]], who later rise to the ranks of an [[Apotheon]], was displeased at how [[The Church|The Church Of Final Atonement]] abandoned the boys and anyone else without standing.

Orpheous admired [[Aroden]] from that point forward, and even followed [[Aroden]] and his teachings once [[Ardoen]] broke away from [[The Church|The Church Of Final Atonement]].  While [[Azarad]] was unimpressed with [[Aroden]] and his teachings, Orpheous became and ardent follower.  Under [[Aroden's|Aroden]] tutelage, Orpheous learned to harness the power of the storm, both literally and metaphorically.  [[Aroden]] saw in Orpheous a kindred spirit - a warrior who harbored a deep compassion for those in need.  [[Aroden's|Aroden]] teachings helped Orpheous to channel his rage into a force for good, honing his [[Aasimar]] traits into a weapon against those who would harm the innocent.  It was Orpheous (in 1026 [[AAP]]) who was among the few who witnessed [[Aroden's|Aroden]] ascension.

!The Demons Within
Despite his successes, Orpheous struggled with inner demons.  The loss of his mother, the harsh realities of life in [[The Lower Streap]], and most of all the weight and guilt of knowing his twin brother's suffering was due to his [[Aasimar]] [[Soul]] consuming his brother in the womb.  After [[Aroden]] ascended, the chains of guilt and regret grew in Orpheous, particularly over his inability to save those he cared for.  This internal conflict led him into a deep depression, one that even his connection to [[Aroden]] could not fully alleviate.  He hid his pain beyond a smiling face, and always was quick with wit and humor in order to entertain his brother and ensure that [[Ozzy's|Azarad]] final days were ones that were lived well - and not overshadowed by Orpheous's pain.

!A Student Of Thievery
It was his brother [[Ozzy|Azarad]] who after his rejection to attend [[Baldarrain University]] suggested they enter into the service of [[The Brotherhood]], local businessmen who would house and train those in need.  Orpheous knew this was risky, and how many never were able to break free from the debt that would be accumulated by working with [[The Brotherhood]].  However, Orpheous would follow his brother into any danger, regardless of the risks and consequences.</pre>

While the Otyugh are not [[Dathairä]], they do originate from [[The Abyss]].  They are known as The Dark Young Of [[Draizon]], as they are continuously birthed from [[The Elder God|The Elder Gods]], either consumed again into [[Draizon's|Draizon]] miasmatic form or escape to some monstrous life elsewhere.

The Otyugh are grotesque, bulbous creatures borne along on three sturdy legs, its sensory organs are set along a vine-like stalk that snakes from the top of its bloated body.  Thick snake like tentacles that end in spikey, leaf-like appendages are used to shovel food into its gaping maw.  They plod along on three sturdy legs, but are more content to wait in ambush in mounds of detritus and carrion, leaving only its sensory stalk exposed.  They smell putrid like rotting flesh.

These creatures are usually called upon to preside over cult ceremonies.  One means of summoning them is found in [[The Book Of Mig'dran]] and requires a blood offering.  Cultists have been able to extract what is called [[The Milk Of Draizon]] from these creatures - granting those that drink fierce and dark mutations.

!Description
Oxam is a newer city compared to those of equal size, first springing up as a way-stop on the trade road linking [[The Stone Lands]] to [[The Waste]].  As it grew, [[House Greenwood]] was compelled to install a governor of the territory - raising [[House Crayclaw]] to noble status.  The roads are all dirt, and the buildings are all one story and roofed with straw with the exception of [[Stormhammer's Spire]].

!Social Customs
* Being a trading town, there are many transient folks visiting the city.  It is illegal to carry bladed weapons or strung bows in the city.  Weapons may be checked into the armory and bows must be unstrung.

Ozryel was one of the venerated [[AstraKashira]] created by [[Lucian]] to combat the malevolent scourge that is [[Azarad-Ji]] and defend against the relentless [[Dathairä]].  Ozryel was one of the first three [[AstraKashira]] dispatched to confront the darkness.

During a pivotal battle against [[Drelmor]], the vicious lieutenant of [[Azarad-Ji]], Ozryel was engaged in a ferocious struggle.  [[Drelmor's|Drelmor]] larger size and strength gave him the advantage, allowing him to pin Ozryel against the ground.  In a moment of desperation and instinctual response, Ozryel attacked and bit on the throat of [[Drelmor]], drinking the corrupted blood of the [[Dathairä]].  This act triggered a slow, terrifying and unseen transformation within Ozryel.

Ozryel emerged from the fight more impulsive and capable of rages of uncontrollable bloodlust.  The remainder of the war saw Ozryel unleash savage brutality against the [[Dathairä]], swaying the tide of the war but at a staggering cost.  The peers of Ozryel were left in shock and consternation, witnessing the abrupt deviation from the inherent ideals and virtues.

As the battles drew to a close and [[Azarad-Ji]] and his malevolent cohorts were vanquished and ensnared within their celestial prison, Ozryel no longer had an outlet for their perverse focus on blood.  Ozryel's descent took a horrific turn, when consumed with a sadistic thirst they attacked a fellow [[AstraKashira]] and drank their silvery blood.

With heavy burden in her heart by the fall of one of her own, [[Lucian]] decreed Ozryel be punished for their transgressions.  In an act of divine justice, the [[AstraKashira]] immobilized Ozryel, impaling them to the earth with a beam of divine light.  Ozryel's body was then sundered into seven segments, each piece scattered across the newly formed lands of [[Asha]]; the tomb of [[Valouria]].

!The Ancients
Yet the repercussions of Ozryel's dismemberment and the essence they harbored didn't simply dissipate.  Over time, Ozryel's accursed and corrupted parts slowly seeped into the dirt and mingled with the burial sites of [[Mankind|Human]].  From these scattered remnants were spawned [[The Ancients]].  Seven beings possessing preternatural power and the thirst for blood.  They formed the progenitors to [[Vampires|Vampire]].</pre>

A Paladin swears an [[Oath|Paladin Oaths]] to stand against the forces of evil, committing their lives selflessly to the purpose of serving their [[God|The Gods]], undaunted by the trials and tribulations that are placed before them - seeing them as tests of their faith, duty and honor.  Paladins are all broken people who have shouldered weights, stood straight, and persevered. True strength derives from hardship and challenge, and Paladins believe it is easy for one to remain strong of heart if never challenged with adversity. The Paladin undergoes constant rigorous mental and physical conditioning, but it is the strength of their heart not steel or skill that differentiates a Paladin.
!First Light
First Light is the name the Paladin’s give to the event when they first see their [[guardian angel|AstraKashira]]. The Paladin takes on the name of an angel as a symbol of rebirth under the banner of their [[God|The Gods]].
!Self Sacrifice
Paladins feel a calling to their work, a drive powered by a divine connection that unites their physical, mental, and spiritual selves to a level that
rivals the [[Cleric]]. They take an [[Oath|Paladin Oaths]] that binds them to their cause. Sometimes their [[Oaths|Paladin Oaths]] lead them into
the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.
!Leading Through Example
A Paladin is a living embodiment of their [[Oath|Paladin Oaths]], leading others through their example. They understand that following their tenets is a calling they have placed upon themselves vs a creed they expect everyone to live by. Many Paladins, rather than preach for those to convert to follow their [[Oath|Paladin Oaths]], will humbly show by example a way to live through adversity and challenge without compromising ones morals.
!Reputation And Honor
A compulsion to be viewed in a favorable light guides the actions and deeds of every Paladin. They all recognize their actions not only reflect on their
own character, but have the ability to either tarnish or bolster the opinion other have of their religion and their [[God|The Gods]]</pre>

!Description
Palm Flora is a city on the continent of [[Amon]] found within [[The Polité Of Bronze]].  It is a large and prosperous independent port city, perhaps the most influential merchant city along [[The Risen Reef]].  From their high perches in the [[Upper City|Palma Flora Upper City]], the local nobles (known as [[Patriars|Patriar]]) gaze down with veiled contempt upon the common rabble in the grimy [[Lower City|Palma Flora Lower City]] which hugs the foggy harbor.

The whole of Palma Flora reeks of blood, crime and opportunity.  One can easily fathom why pirates and traders are drawn to this place like flies to a carcass.  The [[Patriars|Patriar]] pay a mercenary army called [[The Keepers]] to protect their interests in the city, and by extension, the city itself.  The [[Patriars|Patriar]] elect five among them as a governing body, known as [[Princeps]].  The [[Patriars|Patriar]] here have become increasingly out of touch with the common folk, and are generally have a reputation of callousness.  The common folk hold the [[Patriar]] in contempt, as they are out of touch with everyday life and value citizens' lives so cheaply.

The city is built on the rocky shore with poor soil, but boasts the best bay on the coast.  It receives frequent mist and drizzle, causing fog to hang in the harbor and across the [[Lower City|Palma Flora Lower City]].  The city boasts an advances sewer and drainage system to remove all of the excess water, and direct it towards a massive cistern within [[The Temple District|Palma Flora Temple District]].  Despite this feat of engineering, the cellars here are often damp and the smell of mildew is common.

Those that live here are very tolerant of races and religions, to the point of ambivalence.  Anyone wishing to make a coin is welcome to call Palma Flora home, and the city tends to collect misfits.

Palma Flora is perfectly situated on the coast to be a commercial hub.  Craftspeople, merchants, traders, and smugglers all make a brisk living in the city, and many immigrants are drawn to the dream that anyone willing to work hard can be successful here.

!Social Customs
[[The Carnival Of Coin]] is celebrated each Spring, a time where more of the large merchant ships from across [[Asha]] find themselves in port unloading their goods.  There are games, festivities, and many good deals in the makeshift stalls setup across the city.

!Adventure Hooks
''Rob From The Rich'' - Arriving just in time for a semiannual bazaar known as [[The Carnival Of Coin]], the characters begin to notice a strange trance like state that temporarily overtakes a number of wealthy merchants who then sell off their most expensive wares for next to nothing.  These merchants hire the characters to find the source of this enchantment, which turns out to be a wandering band of charlatans who seek to redistribute wealth to the poor.  The characters must decide whether they wish to turn in these thieves for rewards from the merchants, or let them go and risk becoming hunted alongside them.
''The Tower's Secrets'' - The young mage who recently came under the ownership of [[The Tower Of Unadarin]] is woefully unprepared for the task of opening the upper floors of the tower.  Filled with traps and dangers from the previous owner, he seeks able bodied adventurers who are willing to place themselves at risk to help him fully unlock his new home.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/kellos/the-isles/zylok/the-athenaeum/penelope-kensington/penelope-kensington.jpg]]
Penelope Kensington (c. 980 [[AAP]] to Current) is a witch who teaches [[Divination]] at [[The Athenaeum]]. She is rarely surprised, but when she is she is incredibly delighted. She has bright red hair and enjoys wearing the color green. She is good friends with [[Nester Arkwood]], who consults with her and her talents on matters of great import.

Penelope was born to [[House Kensington]], a noble [[Minor House|Houses Of The Viridian Empire]] aligned to [[House Vaisanan]].  As a child, she was taught by her father the skill of [[Divination]].  She took to it naturally, and unlike her father was prone to rare premonitions that would predict great events.  These would come on suddenly like an affliction, with great pain and force - luckily they did not happen often.  Her first was as a young teen, where she knew that if she did not leave her family that they would be doomed.  Without informing her father, she ran off with a circus named [[Hooper's Dreamland]] and began telling fortunes to commoners.  This circus was a front for a criminal enterprise that pick pocketed noble audience members - and Penelope embraced this new lifestyle.  She connected with the idea of common folk getting their just due from nobles.  Here her powers grew through practice, and she picked up skills like [[Thieves' Cant]].  She left the circus when they began asking more from her, and wanting her to use her powers against the common folk.

Her travels brought her to the city of [[Zylok]], where she set up shop in [[The Docks]] selling fortunes to those most in need.  Again, her affliction took hold and she felt a great disturbance in [[The Eternal Cycle]] centered around [[The Athenaeum]].  At great haste, she sought out [[Headmaster]] [[Nester Arkwood]] to inform him of her concern.  To her surprise, [[Nester Arkwood]] was very aware of the schism in [[The Eternal Cycle]] caused by [[The Chrono Ocullum]] and was actively attempting to free [[The Grey Companions]] from a time loop.  She was able to confer with [[Nester Arkwood]] and assist in brainstorming methods to solve the time paradox.  He was so impressed that he hired her as a [[Professor]] at [[The Athenaeum]] on the spot.

At [[The Athenaeum]], she excelled.  She quickly found herself at home, with other people of power like her.  One person in particular stood out to Penelope.  [[Artimas Meliger]] became an object of affection for her, and she actively flirts with him yet he is oblivious.

In 1025 [[AAP]], she revealed herself to be a member of [[The Remnant]], attacking and killing [[Nester Arkwood]] in order to retrieve [[The Shard Of Sakkrad]] and bring about the resurrection of [[The Whispered One]] in an event known as [[The Black Night]].

In this weakened state, Peregial was mired in [[Alyxian's|Alyxian]] despair.  In the end, overcome with madness, she attacked [[The Travelers]] as they entered [[Alyxian's|Alyxian]] chambers.

Perhaps the chief misconception about the pimenta plant is its red-hot reputation.  The fact of the matter is that the elongated peppers often are fiery-hot, but many others are sweet, mild, or richly flavored.

The pepper grows local to the northeastern region near [[Pelquin]].  Locals have adopted the plant for culinary uses, falling in love with the spicy taste.  The seeds of the pimenta are the main source of the pepper’s heat.  The seeds can be removed, dried and grounded to form a potent powder that can easily be stored and applied to food as needed.

Younger peppers may also be harvested and ground to form a paste or sauce, which is often flavored with other vegetables to add flavor and texture.</pre>

As mortal beings are very susceptible to the influences of [[The Planes Of Existence]], any exposure to another [[Plane|The Planes Of Existence]] can cause both temporary and permanent changes to their spiritual and physical selves.  Those changed by a [[Plane|The Planes Of Existence]] are considered Planetouched.  Some come away from this contact with haunting memories, others find that the planar forces cause mutations that cause them to be mixed with a little of the [[Plane|The Planes Of Existence]].

It began as [[GURPS]] and shifted into [[D&amp;D 5E|D&amp;D]].  It was during this time when [[Brian|Brian Disbrow]] dusted off this wiki and began documenting more clearly the world of [[Asha]].

!The Dropouts
[[Elizabeth Disbrow]] returned home from high school during the height of COVID in 2020 with the idea of bringing some of her friends together to share the world of [[Asha]] and [[D&amp;D]].  [[Brian Disbrow]] was the Game Master, leading a couple new players through the experience.  The idea [[Brian|Brian Disbrow]] had was to simulate the high school experience with the [[Wizardry]] school known as [[The Athenaeum]]; then expand into world-saving hijinx. The gang crossed into many other dimensions, reassembled [[The Spire Of Planes]], and once again defeated [[The Whispered One]] who was rising again in power and influence.

!The Apotheons
This campaign was run by [[Brian Disbrow]], with the intent of creating a set of Level 20 characters.  Unbeknownst to the players, they started the campaign as [[Apotheons|Apotheon]]; sparks of divine light who had the ability to grow and become [[Gods|The Gods]].  They began to realize that [[The Divine Gate]] was fractured, and a creature known as [[Yuv'Dah'Akh]] was breaking [[The Gate|The Divine Gate]] in order to escape.  In an epic twist, one of the most powerful among the group, [[Whyenne Loom]], refused the lust for eternal power - instead choosing to spend the remainder of his mortal days making amends with his estranged [[father|Caxton Loom]].

!The Thieves
This campaign took place within the mysterious continent of [[Ruje]], where the land was pummeled with [[Magical|Magic]] [[Highstorms|Highstorm]], and the city of [[Tszanthus]] was run by [[The Council Of Thieves]].  With [[Brian Disbrow]] as the Game Master, [[Maika Danford]], [[Elizabeth Disbrow]], [[Erin Disbrow]], and [[Tyler Disbrow]] each began as humble thieves within [[The Lower Streap]]; deep in debt to [[The Council Of Thieves]].

!Description
Port Merona is a city of [[The Hegemony]], and the only city on the mainland of [[Ruje]].  The mighty river [[Vanji|The Vanji]] flows out to see near the port, and acts as a conduit for the difficult journey deeper into the dense jungle known as [[The Sorrow]].

Port Merona was founded long ago on the jungle mainland of [[Ruje]] as a [[Kuo-Toa]] villiage long before other races arrived. It's original name is neigh unpronounceable by other races, &quot;Murgurgula&quot;. It is the [[Kuo-Toa]] who live here that are masters of traversing the dangerous [[Moonsea|The Moonsea]], making it impossible to travel safely without a [[Kuo-Toa]]. They form one of the most prosperous and richest merchantile guilds in the region, known as [[The Children Of Murgurgula]]. They safely guard the secret of safely sailing [[The Moonsea]]. Due to this fact, it is the [[Kuo-Toa]] who actually rule in the city; despite an [[Octarch]] ruling formally.

Before a Priest can offer his services to a desired church, he must perform at least 2 years of missionary work.  This is to enhance the wisdom and of the Priest, as well as to help spread the word of [[The Gods]].

When becoming a Priest, an [[Acolyte]] severs any political or family ties by striping away their house/family name.  They only recognize their first name.

Proculus Vindex (958 [[AAP]] - Current) is the [[Tribune]] of [[The Polité Of Bronze]] of [[The Amoni Concord]], [[The Elder Of Bronze]], [[The Grand Lotus]], and the governor of [[Sirmium]].  Author of &quot;[[Moral Being]]&quot;, and master orator of [[Amon]].

Historian, lawyer, and scholar, he plays an important role among the other [[Tribunes|Tribune]] by offering wise and thoughtful council.  Proculus is a prolific writer, and has extensive writings on many topics, most notable on Ethics, Morals, and Philosophy.  He is considered one of [[Amon's|Amon]] greatest authors and orators.  A new renaissance of thought was inspired by his teachings, as he believes [[Human]] ingenuity is the most powerful force on [[Asha]].

He is beloved by the citizens of his [[Polité]], for he is known to be a man of the people.  Setting aside his position, he frequently meets with the lowliest of people; for he says they are the greatest in need.  Proculus believes he is a servant of the people, rather than their ruler.

Proculus appreciates the balance in the world.  He teaches that all are equal, and that your birthplace does not define you; and you can create your own destiny.  It is [[The Gods]] that grant one purpose, not the government.  Because of this thinking, the [[Patriars|Patriar]] dislike him; this causes challenges for him as they are wealthy and influential across his [[Polité|The Polité Of Bronze]].</pre>

<pre>Inside of the [[Human]] cities it is common to find [[Humans|Human]] and [[Darklings|Darkling]] living together peacefully.  [[Elves|Elf]], [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], [[Gnomes|Gafflinz]], [[Orcs|Orc]] and [[Trolls|Troll]] are very rarely encountered in the civilized parts of the world.  It should be known that the [[Elves|Elf]] are classified as two sub-races: the [[Forana'loloKashira]] and the [[Variona'Sha]].  The [[Forana'loloKashira]] are deeply secured and hidden within their sacred forests, and have no contact with the other races.  While it is true that a small handful of [[Forana'loloKashira]] are found outside of their forests, they are considered eccentric and some have lost the ability to return to their forest homes.  These are often the youngest of the race, who have no memories of [[The Third Age]].

[[Humans|Human]] have contact with the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] and [[Variona'Sha]], and all have very good relations.  The [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] and [[Humans|Human]] have very lucrative trading pacts and the [[Variona'Sha]] are known to trade regularly with the cities close to their borders.  However it is not rare to find an [[Elf]] or [[Dwarf]] in a [[Human]] city.

The [[Gafflinz]] (or Gnomes) are a very strange race that has a higher technology level then the rest of the world.  All cultures have legends of encounters with the [[Gafflinz]], describing them as curious and eccentric - however little to no contact with a [[Gafflinz]] has been had in centuries, and they are but legends to many [[Humans|Human]].

The [[Human]] cities that currently occupy [[Asha]] are often built on the ashes of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  Because of this [[Elven ruins|The Sylvan Empire]] are not uncommon in everyday travels.  It is possible to stumble upon a lost and forgotten [[Elven|Elf]] temple that has not been explored since the great [[Elves|Elf]] themselves fled from it.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/amon/rafail-kallides.jpg]]

Rafail Kallides (977 [[AAP]] - Current) has the title of [[The Salt King]].  He leads the pirate organization known as [[The Mummers]] in [[The Risen Reef]] off of the coast of [[Amon]].  He rules with an iron fist, and is known for being both charismatic and overly brutal to those who wrong him or [[The Mummers]].  His ship, [[The Bone Heart]], strikes fear in those that see it due to being adorned with the bones of his enemies and being able to spit fire from its bow.

Rafail gained the moniker of &quot;The Worm&quot; when he trapped the notorious pirate hunter [[Myrto Stamiade]] in [[The Deadman's Reef]], causing her and her crew to succumb to the petrification effects of a clutch of [[Lindworms|Lindworm]].

Rafail was a long standing and renowned pirate of [[The Mummers]] prior to rising to the title of [[The Salt King]] in 1010 [[AAP]].

!Learning Of The Dark Arts
Through mysterious circumstances, Rafail studies [[Blood Magic]] to suit his own ends, gaining a level of mastery of some incantations.  It is unknown what he had to endure to gain this knowledge, but legends have said that he learned from an ancient tome he uncovered in his piracy.  He gained the power to resurrect those he killed through rituals, and was fascinated with gaining supernatural power.  Rafail is obsessed with [[Magic]], and has dabbled with [[Blood Magic]] for decades to provide him a supernatural edge.  He is too impatient to study [[Wizardry]], was not gifted with [[Sorcery]], and is too independent to submit to [[Occultism]] or [[Divine Favor]].  He wields [[The Sabre Of The Seas]], a sword embedded with a ruby that holds the [[Soul]] of a [[Sorcerer|Sorcery]] that he killed that grants him the power over elements.  When Rafail bested the previous [[Salt King|The Salt King]], [[Caxton Loom]], he raised him as a [[Zombie]] beholden to him; now an enforcer of Rafail's will.

!The Blockade Of Palalia
Rafail's chief claim to fame was the blockade of the port of [[Palalia]], a trading hub of [[The Saffron Isles]].  In 1005 [[AAP]], under the direction of the current [[Salt King|The Salt King]] [[Garrad Stroud]], Rafail lead the blockaded of the port with a small squadron of 4 vessels.  He plundered 5 heavily laden merchant ships attempting to enter or leave port.  No ships could transit the port for fear of being harried by the pirate flotilla.  Among one of the captured ships were a handful of [[Amoni]] nobles, who Rafail kept as prisoner and held ransom in exchange for the unusual demand of a chestful of alchemist supplies and medicines.  The bargaining took days, but was successful.  The nobles were returned unharmed, but without clothing as an embarrassment to their station.

The desert surrounding the city of [[Akabele-ethu]], known as [[The Waste]] is home to bands of marauders who pray on caravans.  The raiders are not exactly one large group, but a collection of clans.  They are excellent horsemen, and experts at desert survival.  The raiders excel in fighting with their hands and feet, making each raider a deadly foe.  They often follow a caravan for days, inflict minor raids not allowing the caravan to rest.  This builds in ferocity until the final attack, when the worn and weary caravan is completely overrun.  The caravan members are not killed, they are only robbed and given enough supplies to ensure they will leave the desert alive.</pre>

Raime was an [[Elf]] that lived during [[The Sylvan Empire]].  He was gifted with [[Foretelling]], and considered a holy icon among his people.  Raime is known for his writing of the [[Larabira]] that describes the creation of [[The Gods]], and his vision of the [[BahaUlla Prophecy]], where he saw a break in [[The Eternal Cycle]] ending in peace and prosperity rather than [[Desecration]].

He warned of [[The Third Desecration]], but not everyone listened.  Those that did fled the cities of [[The Sylvan Empire]] to become the [[Forana'loloKashira]].  Much of the events of his life were lost to history, and only fragments of the story survive.

[[Zezebazum]] tempted him to become the final and most powerful [[Kiraga]], but Raime refused - stalling the events of [[The Third Desecration]].  It is not known if Raime survived the exodus of the cities.</pre>

In order to establish a standard currency in his kingdom, [[Tarmon Gellius]] began to mint Red Queens nearly 3000 years ago.  The queens are minted from silver, and dyed a bright red.  Their name was thought of by the King himself, who wished for his beautiful wife to be immortalized on the face of his [[Currency]].  The tradition of emblazoning the coin's face with a prominent woman survived through [[The Old Republic]] and into modern times.  The general populace refers to older coins in which the red dye begins to fade as &quot;[[Naked Queens]]&quot;.</pre>

Red Ruth is a [[Hag]] who lives within an area known as [[The Bone Brambles]] in [[Avernus]].  She is sought out across [[Avernus]] for her skill in [[Divination]].

Although lawful evil, Red Ruth is more whimsical and helpful than her counterparts.  While she does not abide by foolishness or insolent behavior, she is more reasonable and forgiving in the deals that she makes.

Red Ruth has learned powerful [[Blood Magic]] that allows her to remain looking young and beautiful for stretches of time.  In this state, her hair is red with streaks of white, her skin is fair, pale and grey, and he she is tall and statuesque.  After a handful of years without maintenance she transforms slowly into an old crone; her hair becomes grey, her nose elongates, and she develops a large hump on her back that causes her to walk with a hunch.

She is the younger sister of [[Mad Maggie]], who together they once had a [[Coven|Hag Coven]] with another Hag known as [[Old Ethel]], who was killed.  Together they were known as [[The Coven Of The Bramble Root]].  After the death of [[Old Ethel]], the [[Coven|Hag Coven]] disbanded and the two sisters live separately in [[Avernus]].

Red Ruth lives in [[The Bone Brambles]], a former forest from [[The Feywild]] that she and her sister's corrupted by transporting it to [[Baator]].  The spirits of the grove were damned and cursed to haunt the wood.  Pleased with the result, the three sisters made the grove their lair, and named themselves [[The Coven Of The Bramble Root]].

Visitors within [[The Bone Brambles]] are rare, as it's walls shift and confuse those who attempt to traverse it.  However those that reach the center will find Red Ruth willing to sell potions and tinctures. </pre>

!Feature: The Black Sheep
Thanks to your long affiliation with a cult community, you can very easily identify anyone who is a member of a commune similar to your own.  All cults are essentially the same and their members exhibit the same behavioral patterns.  By extension, you can also easily recognize any drug addicts, compulsive liars and people with various behavioral disorders.  Additionally (this is up to you and your DM to decide), some of your former brothers and sisters in faith might not know you have defected and would be willing to provide you (and only you) with shelter and supplies.  However, the question is whether you want to stay with them again.

!Suggested Characteristics
* My past still haunts me in my dreams.  I often wake up screaming or do not sleep at all.
* I anger quickly and I am prone to violent tantrums when someone tries to control me or give me orders.
* Being a pawn in someone else's game left me with an inability to make choices on my own.  I am indecisive.
* I trance out and lose touch with reality.  I am sometimes delusional or experience delirious states.
* Boundaries were violated time and time again in the cult until I lost sense of which boundaries were appropriate. I often behave inappropriately or in a seemingly random manner.
* Constant feelings of shame, helplessness and inferiority make me change my mood at a moment’s notice. I suffer from mood swings or sudden emotional breakdowns.
* I feel immense guilt over my past actions and welcome suffering as my atonement. I have little or no regard for my personal health.
* Every day I expect to get a knife in my gut and I see vengeful assassins in every shadow. I am paranoid or suspicious of others.

!Ideal
* Protective. Dark cults trifle with powers that are beyond their understanding or control. Those fools must be stopped. (lawful)
* Nihilist. What’s the point of anything? People are insignificant and their struggle is futile. (neutral)
* Repentant. I cannot possibly undo the wrongs I have done, but I can still try and atone. (good)
* Anarchist. Lives of men should not be ruled by anyone. No gods, no masters! (chaotic)
* Denial. It wasn’t me. I wasn’t myself! (any)
* Selfish. The world is doomed either way. Better make to most of it. (evil)

!Bond
* When I left the cult, I took one of its relics with me. For some strange reason, I cannot part with it.
* They were supposed to be sacrificed, I have helped them escape. Now I feel responsible for them.
* It breaks my heart to know that my close friend, lover or family member is still a loyal follower of the cult.
* The cult leader made me kill my old friend during the initiation. I have not forgotten that and I want revenge.
* I cannot stand by and watch as more children and youths get turned into mindless fanatics or are exploited for someone else's personal gain.
* No one must ever know about my involvement with the cult.

!Flaw
* Sometimes, I hear voices in my head that command me to do terrible things. And sometimes, I give in.
* I am having second thoughts about my leaving the cult. I am afraid I could easily return to my old ways given the right circumstance.
* I take great solace in flagellation. The road to salvation leads through blood and self-inflicted pain.
* Before I left, I was given a task (by the dark lord or deity, or the cult leader) that I am yet to fulfill.
* In the cult, they fed us drugs. I am still heavily addicted and I will do anything to get a dose.
* I dread the idea of killing another sentient creature, I have already spilled enough blood. 

!Notable Cults
* __[[The Penitentine Sect]]__ is a small group of outlaws that fight militantly against [[Magic]].  Led by a religious zealot called [[Pious John]], they believe [[Magic]] is unholy and must be scourged from [[Asha]].
* __[[The Risen]]__ are a loose collection of worshipers of [[Azarad-Ji]], said to be led by [[Azarad-Ji]] himself - despite him being locked away in an inescapable prison.</pre>

<div title="Reliquary" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202303051739" modified="202408160108" tags="artifact" changecount="21">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/items/artifacts/reliquary.jpg]]
A Reliquary is a striking and otherworldly object, created using [[Umbramancy]] by the [[Draugaira]] [[Elves|Elf]] in [[The Third Age]].  They are crystalline in nature, derived from [[Gloomglow]] which is found in [[The Shadowfell]].  The reliquary's surface shimmers with a kaleidoscope of colors in the light.  The crystal itself is multi-faceted, casting prisms of iridescence in every direction.  The metal cage that surrounds the crystal is equally impressive, consisting of an intricate lattice of silver and gold that seems to pulse with a faint magical energy.  The metal is finely wrought, with delicate filigree and intricate designs that hint at the arcane power contained within.

The crystal is roughly the size of a cannonball, and when placed inside of the metal lattice it glows with spiritual energy.  Each lattice is special built, typically at the center of a [[Draugaira]] city, replacing the [[Elven|Elf]] custom of a [[Hearttree]].  There are only a dozen Reliquaries that are known to have been made, for which only eleven remain within the possession of the [[Draugaira]].

!Resurrection And Rebirth
When an [[Elf]] dies near a Reliquary, their [[Soul]] is drawn within where it is stored until the time comes for reincarnation.  The Reliquary holds [[their spirit|Soul]] inside rather than letting it pass to [[The Fields Of Kalara]], until such a time that the [[Elf]] is reborn again.  One must live in the vicinity of the Reliquary for the [[Soul]] to become &quot;soul-bound&quot; in this manner.

The [[Draugaira]] carefully guard and protect this artifact, and it serves as the central heart of their cities. To the [[Draugaira]], the Reliquary is not just a means of preserving their numbers, but a symbol of their unity and resilience in the face of adversity. They hold it in the highest reverence, and its maintenance is seen as a sacred duty.
There is a deep spiritual significance to the Reliquary. The [[Souls|Soul]] of their ancestors reside within it, and the artifact itself is imbued with a sacred energy that connects them to their past and future. It is a source of comfort and hope for the [[Draugaira]].

!The Whispered One
The Reliquary was originally designed by a powerful [[Draugaira]] [[Umbramancer|Umbramancy]] in [[The Third Age]] named [[Nullaefe]] (&quot;Little Song in [[Elvish]]).  It was crafted in a response to the genocide of the [[Draugaira]] people by the [[Human]] overlord [[Ammenon]] in his thirst for immortality.  [[Nullaefe]] not only pioneered [[Umbramancy]], but harnessed the power of [[Gloomglow]] crystals from [[The Shadowfell]] in order to built the first and only 12 Reliquary's.  A feat that had not been replicated until [[Hassomir]] 1188 (946 [[AAP]]) by [[Niiralagaaerä]].</pre>

The Relk are creatures native to northern [[Kellos]]. They have a silvery translucent skin with dark blue stripes that is soft to the touch. On their back is a mane of silver spines that help it move gracefully underwater. Their tail has a long fin on the back that moves through the water at speeds that have never been measured. They are amphibious and move like a fish in the water, and have strong claws that allow them to cling to cliffs during strong winds. They have a crystal on their head which stores lightning, allowing a burst of energy that hastens their movements when panicked. They travel in packs called families, and mate for life which is about 100 years. Sailors claim that where there are large gatherings of Relk, there are storms.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Therefore, they are considered a bad omen if they are seen close to civilization or ships.  The Relk are easily shy, due to this few have seen one in their entire lifetime.</pre>

Death is an essential part of [[The Eternal Cycle]], yet there remain those that were taken before their time.  Some magic grants the power to pull [[souls|Soul]] back into a mortal coil, granting a chance to live again.  Those that have died and come back may be changed by the ordeal, depending on the duration their [[Soul]] remained in the after-life.

If a creature is dead, and a resurrection is attempted by magical means by a spell with a casting time longer than a single action, a ''Resurrection Challenge'' is initiated.  Up to 3 individuals can offer to contribute to the ritual via a Contribution Skill Check.  The DM asks them each to make a skill check based on their form of contribution, with the DC of the check adjusting to how helpful/impactful the DM feels the contribution would be.  For example, praying to the god of the devout, fallen character may require an Intelligence (Religion) check at an easy to medium difficulty, where loudly demanding the [[Soul]] of the fallen to return from the aether may require a Charisma (Intimidation) check at a very hard or nearly impossible difficulty.  Advantage and disadvantage can apply here based on how perfect, or off base the contribution offered is.

After all contributions are completed, the DM then rolls a single, final Resurrection success check with no modifier.  The base DC for the final resurrection check is ''10'', increasing ''1'' for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone (signifying the slow erosion of the [[Soul's|Soul]] connection to this world).  For each successful contribution skill check, this DC is decreased by ''3'', whereas each failed contribution skill check increases the DC by ''1''.  Upon a successful resurrection check, the creature's [[Soul]] (should it be willing) will be returned to the body, and the ritual succeeded.  On a failed check, the [[Soul]] does not return and the character is lost.

Only the strongest of magical incantations can bypass this resurrection challenge, in the form of the True Resurrection or Wish spells.  These spells can also restore a character to life who was lost due to a failed resurrection ritual.

If a spell with a casting time of 1 action is used to attempt to restore life (via the Rivivify spell or similar effects), no contribution skill checks are allowed.  The character casting the spell makes a Rapid Resurrection check, rolling a d20 and adding their spellcasting ability modifier.  The DC is 10, increasing by 1 for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone.  On a failure, the character's [[Soul]] is not lost, but the resurrection fails and increases any future Resurrection checks DC by 1.  No further attempts can be made to restore this character to life until a resurrection spell with a casting time higher than 1 action is attempted.</pre>

<pre>Being &quot;Returned To The Stone&quot; is a [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] burial tradition.  This custom is much more than just simple internment of the dead; and is seen as a means by which the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] return their [[Soul]] to their creator, [[Kombar]].  The actual funerals are often followed or preceded with large feats that are filled with eating, drinking and merriment.  The act of returning to the stone is seen as one of glory, not of sadness.

!The Stone Sleep
For common [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], their burial is known as [[The Stone Sleep]].  This ritual is steeped in the belief that even in death one should serve to protect the [[Stronghold]].  When they pass, their stomach is filled with stones and sewn back up.  The corpse is then brought to the weakest section of the settlement's walls, as determined by a chief mason.  They are petrified and joined with the wall.  This is considered one of the highest callings a [[Dwarf]] can aspire to.

!Mountain Halls
Large tombs are built for nobility and those [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] that held a position of power and privilege.  These crypts hold the many bodies of the most revered members of the [[Stronghold]], with intricate stonework and statues to showcase the great reverence these citizens meant to them.  For those of high station, they receive their own rooms decorated to a degree that befits their status.</pre>

Rhûn was the name of an ancient [[Kellish|Kell]] tribe that lived in [[The Northlands]] of [[Kellos]] in [[The Third Age]].  They shunned the ways of [[The First Men]], and of the [[Kell]]; surviving with treachery, and taking from other tribes by force.  Rhûn practiced powerful [[Magic]] giving them an edge that made their warriors formidable.

While other [[Kellish|Kell]] tribes were nomadic, the Rhûnic people settled in a small village a half days travel northeast from the village of [[Vargë]].  The ruins of their village are no more than rubble.  An unknown fate befell them, only blood and signs of battle remained in their village.  Their [[Souls|Soul]] still haunt [[The Weeping Wood]], unable to fund rest.  Their village is considered taboo for [[Kell]].

!The Downfall Of The Rhûnic People
In 4031 [[IO]], in [[The Third Age]], the tribe of [[Rhûn]] was slaughtered.  10 years prior, the [[Elf]] maiden [[Minuka]] (&quot;First To Dance&quot; in [[Elvish]]) joined the tribe with her daughter [[Namarie 'Eithla]] (&quot;Farewell To Spring&quot;), an [[Achasiono]] who would have been banished from [[The Sylvan Empire]].  Unlike her [[Elvish|Elf]] kin, she saw a spark in these primitive [[Humans|Human]]; and attempted to guide their growth and study of [[Magic]].

<pre>[&gt;img[images/bestiary/ruje/rock-drake.jpg]]

Rock Drakes are a very rare species of beast that are only found in the region of [[Ruje]] near and around the city of [[Sharat'Kur]].  Here, they have been domesticated by the people of [[The Hegemony]].  Rock Drakes scale between 10 to 20 feet long and 5 to 6 feet tall.  They have stone-like scales on portions of their body, this along with a tinge of natural [[Magic]] allow them to blend into their surroundings.  They have a frill of feathers that begins at their head and reaches along their back to the tip of their tails.  Rock Drakes also have small wings on their front legs which allow for them to glide short distances, but not fly.  Rock Drakes have an intelligence akin to most dogs, and are extremely social creatures.  A single Rock Drake will die if not surrounded by their kin.  They often bond with their owners and can remember the face and voice of them for their entire lives.

Rock Drakes have only been seen to naturally occur near [[Sharat'Kur]]. They eat the small blue shrimp-like creatures known as [[Chakalin]] which thrive in the waters there.  The alien teal glow of the [[Chakalin]] is the cause of the colorful plumage of the Rock Drake's feathers.  The younglings lack the tint of blue until their first few meals.  Nests are found at the highest hard to reach spires, and often contain around 4-5 eggs.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/ruje/ruje.jpg]]
Ruje is a content of [[Asha]], full of dense jungle and surrounded by treacherous waters.  Its geography has caused it to be remote and isolated.  The land is full of savage [[Beasts|Bestiary]], hulking [[Dinosaurs]], and disease-ridden swamps.  Nonetheless, the region of Ruje is full of treasures and legendary riches.

It is bordered to the north by the continent of [[Amon]], separated by a mountain chain known as [[The Shackles]] which are difficult to traverse.  To the east is [[The Moonsea]], which can only be navigated safely by the [[Kuo-Toa]] (who pride themselves on that monopoly).  The closest thing to a regional government is [[The Hegemony]] which is a loose federation of city state.

!Geography
The region is dominated by the dense jungle known as [[The Sorrow]], cut through by a mighty river known as [[The Vanji|The Vanji River]].  At the mouth of the river is the city of [[Port Merona]], one of [[The Freeholds Of The Hegemony|The Hegemony]].  It is the only city on the mainland of Ruje, the others situated on a large island to the east across [[The Moonsea]].

!History
Little is recorded about the region's ancient history, but the landscape is dotted with ruins of collapsed civilizations.  Fabled to lie deep within the dense jungle are tribes of [[Quori]], cities of [[Saurial]], secret cults of [[Yuan-Ti]], and relics of [[The First Age]].  Many have tried to tame this land, from [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]] of [[The Third Age]] to [[The Amoni Empire]], each could retain but a foothold in the harsh and forgiving region.</pre>

<pre>The focus and study of a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] on the physical manifestation of [[Magic]] using [[Runes]] is known as Runemancy.  Runemantic scholars are students of [[History]], [[Magic]], and [[Language]].  They recognize that each culture strives to harness more permanent and potent [[Magic]], and have done so with their own linguistic set of magical [[Runes]].

!Masters Of Ritual
Runemancers have an unmatched aptitude for rites and rituals.  They see [[Runes]] for what they are, one of the most primitive forms of arcane practice, which can be formidable in the hands of a master.

!The Three Tenants Of Runes
For a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] to properly transcribe or use a Rune, there are three tenants that must be adhered to and known: Dialect, Durability, and Context.  The study of these tenants is known as [[Runemancy]].

| ''Dialect'' |As spells were invented across multiple cultures, a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] must become proficient in the [[Language]] from where the spell originated in order to both cast and write the spell in physical form. |
| ''Durability'' |The material used to write the Rune, as well as the surface it is inscribed upon affect the potency and durability of the [[Magic]]. |
| ''Context'' |The context of how the Rune was written (eg hastily, meticulously, artistically) can inadvertently affect the casting of the Rune. |

Many fisherman tell tales of seeing a creature within [[Lake Acharutha]].  They tell of a large serpentine head, and sharp jagged teeth that can rend an unsuspecting ship in two.  This monster they have affectionately named ‘Ruthie’.  Ruthie spans 20-100 feet in length, depending on the story you listen to.  She also can be quite friendly, or ferocious.  Those fishermen who have been mysteriously lost in the lake have been said to be eaten by Ruthie.

The truth behind the stories is that there are in fact creatures living in the shadowy depths of [[Lake Acharutha]].  There are a few groups of these long necked reptiles who have been living in the lake long before the [[Human|Human]] arrived.  They thrive on the abundant fish that live in the lake.  Ocassionally, one of these monsters may be seen rising to the surface for a breath of air, but they are shy, staying away from the fisherman.  The creatures also find the fisherman’s presence helpful, often dining on the fish caught within their nets.  When the mist forms on the lake, the creatures can sometimes be heard forming long low sounding hums and grumbles.  This only adds to the fear of Ruthie and the lake.</pre>

Salix Daelof (c. 974 [[AAP]] to Current) is the loud and boisterous keeper of animals at [[The Athenaeum]].  He is a tough as nails [[Dwarf]], and the keeper of [[The Menagerie]]. He is excellent with the care of exotic animals. He will speak of anything other than the means by which he lost his eye. He is good friends with [[Artimas Meliger]], as the two of them studied together as young boys in [[The Athenaeum]].

Although he does not have favorite animals, he has two that have strong bonds with him.  The first is a [[Blink Dog]] named [[Julius]], and the second is a [[Mimic]] named [[Chester]].  He has trained [[Chester]] to accept food from out of his hand, which is a enormous feat considering the predatory nature of [[Mimics|Mimic]].  As a special gift, [[Nester Arkwood]] enchanted a leash for [[Julius]] that prevents him from blinking, and therefore limits the amount of trouble he can get into.

He excels at training animals of all varieties and types, however there is only one animal type that he refuses to tame - felines.  He never explains why, but it is clear he has some strong emotion related to the subject - and even seems uneasy around the beasts no matter their size or temperament.

Forced to toil under the lash of his masters, he endured the cruelty of his captors until a fateful uprising led to his liberation.  Rising from the shackles of bondage, Samuanya emerged as a symbol of resilience and defiance against tyranny.

With Samuanya at the helm, the enslaved populace found the courage to defy their oppressors.  With whispered promises of freedom and justice, Samuanya emerged as the beacon of hope admist the darkness of subjugation.  In a daring bid for freedom, Samuanya marshaled his comrades into a formidable force, akin to the roaring thunder of a gathering storm.  With each passing day, their ranks swelled with those who yearned for liberty, their spirits emboldened by the unwavering resolve of their [[Saurial]] leader.

Though their uprising burned bright with the flames of defiance, it was not without its sacrifices.  Samuanya and his comrades faced the fury of their [[Yuan-Ti]] oppressors, locked in a harrowing struggle for their very survival.  In the crucible of conflict, many brave souls fell, their blood mingling with the soil of their ancestral homeland.  Samuanya met his end in this battle, becoming a martyr of freedom.  He rose as an [[Apotheon]].

!The Miracles Of Samuanya
During his ascension to [[Apotheon]], Samuanya wrought three miracles. First, he crippled the [[Yuan-Ti]] by killing the masters with a wave of his hand, and freeing the [[Saurial]].  Second, he opened the doors of [[Elysium]] and [[Baator]] for the [[Souls|Soul]] of the [[Beast Races|Races]].  Third, he united the [[Saurial]] and [[Quori]] of [[Ruje]] under a common banner of freedom and solidarity, forging powerful alliance that transcends [[Race]] and creed.</pre>

Sanders (977 [[AAP]] - 1009 [[AAP]]) was born to unknown parentage in the city of [[Zylok]] in [[Kellos]].  He grew up in an orphanage, dreaming of adventure and imagining himself as a master of [[Magic]].  He found himself spending more time on the streets of the city than inside the walls of the orphanage, and was amazed by the flourish of the magical street performers.  He would sneak into [[The Athenaeum]] and pose as a student, and even brazenly attended a few classes before being caught by a bemused [[Professor]] [[Nester Arkwood]].  [[Nester Arkwood]] saw the talent and potential in the young lad, who wasn't even yet old enough to be eligible to attend the school.  It was [[Arkwood|Nester Arkwood]] who took Sanders under his wing, and commissioned him to perform odd jobs around the school until he was of age to join properly.  In turn, this granted Sanders the ability to observe classes and even read books from the library.

In time, [[Nester Arkwood]] sponsored his entry into [[The Athenaeum]].  Sanders was more prepared and adept than his peers, and was able to spend his time focused on more advanced studies.  In his first year, Sanders was visited by [[The Grey Companions]] from the year 1023 [[AAP]] who were stuck in a time loop due to [[Erik Doorhaus]] and the failed creation of [[The Chrono Ocullum]].  They visited Sanders multiple times, causing him to be intrigued with time and the question of if free will even exists.  He assisted [[Nester Arkwood]] in solving the dilemma of the time loop, saving [[The Grey Companions]] and perhaps all of [[Asha]] from a horrific fate.

[[Nester Arkwood]] ensured that he was the advisor to Sanders.  Another notable student in the advisory group was [[Seipher Black]] who later became a [[Professor]] of [[Metamagic]] at the school.  [[Seipher Black]] hated Sanders, and visibly showed it.  Everything came so easy for Sanders.  He was popular, smart, and had the favor of the faculty and students; especially their advisor [[Nester Arkwood]].  It was Sanders who was first offered the position of [[Professor]] of [[Metamagic]], which he turned down known he had a greater purpose as hinted by his visit from [[The Grey Companions]].  This made [[Seipher Black]], who was offered the position second, despise him even more.  Before graduation, Sanders wrote and published the book [[Cantrips And Wards]]; an unprecedented feat for one so young.

After graduating from [[The Athenaeum]], he travelled with a fellow classmate [[Celandra Crestfall]] to seek [[The Lost Tower Of Armondax|The Tower Of Armondax]].  This ancestral home of the [[Wizard|Wizardry]] [[Armondax]] was lost to time and steeped in death, conquest, desire and mystery.  The legend of lost magical artifacts guarded by deadly wards and traps encouraged many daring expeditions to unlock the hidden mysteries of one of the greatest [[Wizards|Wizardry]] to have even lived.  The two had many adventures together on their quest, and their successful discovery of the ruins was cause for much celebration amongst [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]], granting the both of them status of [[Magus]] within the group.

In 1009 [[AAP]], Sanders recruited [[Desini Orosco]], [[Erik Doorhaus]], and [[Minerva Carrington]] into [[The Grey Companions]] - completing the time loop.  He remained tight lipped about having met them in his childhood and went on what would become his final mission.  He entered [[The Shadowfell]] with [[Ser]] [[Malden Bray]] through a portal created by [[Magnus Zizorum]].  He closed the portal from the other side, sealing it permanently and was never heard from again.  His fate is unknown.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/kellos/the-stone-lands/brand/santino-jamarion.jpg]]

Santino (960 [[AAP]] - current) is the keeper of house for [[The Grey Companions]].  He is accountable to seeing to the needs of the staff, and administration and upkeep of the house.  He is an older gentleman, accustomed to serving nobility and comfortable around them.  He is literate, charismatic, and a known pacifist. 

Santino's posture is excellent, always standing straight and rigid, carrying himself like a true gentleman.  In his youth, Santino was classically trained on the lyre by the traveling bard [[Duncan Littletoes]], a famous [[Bairn]] who rose to become the court musician for [[House Anwyn]].  Santino is known to be very cautious, and worries unduly about many things.  He worries when he is too far from his wife [[Gretchen Jamarion]], or if items under his care are at risk of damage.  He is generous, kind and friendly.  He is always smiling to a fault, even if he is worried, sick or afraid.

His prized possession is a lyre given to him by his mentor [[Duncan Littletoes]].  The lyre was the same instrument [[Duncan Littletoes]] played in front of the [[Emperor]] [[Jayce Jedaleon II]].

Santino and his wife [[Gretchen Jamarion]] served [[Lord]] [[Nolan Roth]], last of [[House Roth]] for 30 years before [[Nolan Roth]] passed away.  This not only left them devastated that their good friend was gone, but also without a [[Lord]] to care for.  [[Nolan Roth]] before passing made plans to ensure Santino, his wife, and all of his staff were cared for.  To start they inherited some of the meager treasury of [[House Roth]], enough to live a comfortable life.  Second, [[Nolan Roth]] contacted everyone he knew to provide strong recommendations for all of his staff to ensure they would have a new house to serve.  It was this act that brought Santino and his wife to [[The Grey Companions]], as [[Asavir Gallowglass]] provided the reference that brought them together.</pre>

<div title="Sashes" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="201307231910" modified="202207031341" tags="organization GURPS" changecount="24">
<pre>The Sashes are the highest ranking military contingent of [[The Waste]], primarily found within the capital city of [[Akabele-ethu]].  Similar to a [[Knight]], the Sashes are an [[Uskardeen]] tradition of service to one's [[Lord]].  Whereas a [[Knight]] is refered to as &quot;Ser&quot;, a Sash is customarily referred to as татко, meaning &quot;master&quot;.  They are respected as tough fighters, due to their unique fighting style [[борбаtа]].

!Advantages &amp; Disadvantages
A Sash has Legal Enforcement Powers (10 points), Duty [always on duty, 15 or less] (-15 points), Combat Reflexes (15 points), Military Rank (variable), Reputation +2 from citizens, and guardsmen from other cities (5 points).
It costs 15 points to play a Sash.

!Military Rank
0 White Sash, 1 Red Sash, 2 Blue Sash, 3 Copper Sash, 4 Silver Sash, 5 Gold Sash, 6 Lord General

!Patrols
There are 1000 Sashes, in which [[House Tuul]] is in complete control over.  The city watch patrols in groups of 4 men armed with leather armor, batons and short swords.  Their instructions are to arrest and bring into custody any wrongdoers.  Sashes may enter buildings and perform searches at will.  Patrolmen will first attempt to have the arrested person come peacefully, but if this is impossible they will fight.  Sashes are trained to first attempt to grapple or disarm, then subdue.  Killing blows will be used only if one of the watch is seriously wounded, or a dangerous weapon is brandished.  The gate and wall guardsmen wear scale mail, long swords and halberds or spears.  There is always an officer on duty.  The gate guards are known to be a little more dour than patrolmen, and are formidable fighters.

!Law
Weapons may not be worn concealed in the city, and laws exist against brandishing or undue violence.  Any weapon that is worn must be peace bonded to the sheath (tied with a string), bows must be unstrung.  The city closes at nightfall, and curfew is strictly enforced 1 hour later within city walls.  There are 2 levels to the legal system.  The lower level consists of 25 town magistrates (known as [[White Robes]]) who have the authority to place immediate judgement on serious or less important crimes.  A magistrate can always be summoned in 30 minutes to place judgement (which may be appealed and tried before the [[Akabele-ethu Lord’s Court]] within 2 days).  Only registered citizens can appeal, although non-citizens may have a citizen appeal on their behalf.  Prisoners awaiting trial or serving their sentences are kept within the cells beneath the palace.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/bestiary/famous/sathric.jpg]]

Sathric is a [[Shadow Dragon]] born in [[The Shadowfell]] and now living with [[The Grey Companions]] on [[The Material Plane]].  As far as [[Dragons|Dragon]] go, he is a youngling at only 20 years of age.  His mentor was [[Hirador]], an ancient [[Shadow Dragon]] who flew away into the darkness once Sathric was of age to care for himself.  A rift to [[The Material Plane]] was created by [[Magnus Zizorum]], allowing a group of [[Barguul]] to exit and begin to take over [[House Saxon]].  Upon seeing this doorway, Sathric jumped through behind the [[Barguul]], recalling from his racial memory the beauty of [[The Material Plane]].  He met [[The Grey Companions]] as they were defeating the [[Barguul]], and assisted them in their mission.  [[Desini Orosco]], [[Erik Doorhaus]], and [[Minerva Carrington]] took a liking to Sathric and allowed him to stay in the manor despite them knowing of who he really was.

He often takes the form of a bald [[Uskardeen]] male, powerfully built.  His voice remains deep, like that of his true form.  Sathric is very curious about the world, and seeks to understand [[Human]] nature.  He has brief glimpses of past experiences in his mind due to his racial memory - yet he wants to experience the thrill of the world first hand.  Being young, he still has quite a bit to learn - and can appear oblivious or absent minded to simple things.  While he has the body of a man, you can think of his mind more as that of a child.

His racial memory grants him visions of experiences lived by his ancestors.  He has been surprised to find he is an excellent dancer, and skilled at meteorology - despite never having tried those skills in [[The Shadowfell]].

Sathric, like many [[Dragons|Dragon]] is insatiably curious.  As a member of [[The Grey Companions]], he prefers to stay home and read the books within the manor's library rather than go on adventures.  He spends much of his free time with his nose in a book, or sleeping, but does also enjoy speaking with the staff in the manor house.  His favorite person to speak with is [[Santino Jamarion]], for he respects him as an elder - and is constantly asking questions about the minor aspects of life.  The two of them get on very well together, and seem to enjoy their conversations.

[[The Grey Companions]] have been good to Sathric, and treated him fairly despite the fact he was a [[Dragon]].  They even offered for him to join [[The Grey Companions]], however he did not feel himself worthy.  He owes them a great debt however, and is fiercely loyal to them.

His mentor [[Hirador]] raised Sathric in [[The Shadowfell]].  As an ancient [[Dragon]], [[Hirador]] was cruel and callous.  He raised Sathric to be a predator - and feed upon those that weaker (which is everything).  Together, they pillaged the local area - feeding on any life they encountered.  The two [[Dragons|Dragon]] were feared within [[The Shadowfell]], and even at a young age Sathric was able to take down [[Barguul]] and devour them.  When [[Hirador]] left, Sathric was alone to fend for himself.  When Sathric saw the portal to [[The Material Plane]], his racial memory suddenly flooded with experiences of past lives outside of [[The Shadowfell]].  He was filled with regret at the horror of his life up until this point - and jumped through with the plans to begin life anew, to live a good life.</pre>

<div title="Saurial" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202303241823" modified="202303241932" tags="race" changecount="16">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/saurial.jpg]]
!Territorial Xenophobes
Saurial deal and trade with other races only rarely.  They live deep within the jungles of [[Ruje]].  Fiercely territorial, they use camouflaged scouts to guard the perimeter of their domain.  When unwelcome visitors are detected, a tribe sends a hunting band to harass or drive the trespassers off, or tricks them into blundering into the lairs of crocodiles and other dangerous creatures.
Saurial have no notion of traditional morality, and they find the concepts of good and evil utterly alien.  Truly neutral creatures, they kill when it is expedient and do whatever it takes to survive.
Saurial rarely stray beyond their claimed hunting grounds.  Any creature that enters their territory is fair game to be stalked, killed, and devoured.  They make no distinction between humanoids, beasts, and monsters.  Similarly, Saurial don't like reaching too far beyond their borders, where they could easily become the hunted instead of the hunters.

!Great Feasts And Sacrifices
Saurial are omnivorous, and have no concerns with eating humanoids.  Prisoners are often taken back to their camps to become the centerpieces of great feasts and rites involving dancing, storytelling, and ritual combat.  Victims are either cooked and eaten by the tribe, or are sacrificed to [[Samuanya]] and [[Sess'inek]], the Saurial [[Gods|The Gods]].

!Language
The Saurial are incapable of vocalization and communicate only through olfactory means.  These scents can convey multiple concepts at once, but are often based upon emotions such as grief, happiness, danger, or fear.  Written communication is non existent, however they have developed a means of horticulture which allows them to physically manifest thoughts and ideas physically to future generations through plants and scents.

!Modern Dinosaurs
There is a wide variety of Saurial body types and shapes, and they group themselves into [[Clades|Saurial Clades]].  Some [[Saurial Clades]] are: Finheads, Hornheads, Bladebacks, Sharptooth, and Greatnecks.

!Hard To Read
Most humanoids show their emotions on their face and with their mannerisms, however the Saurial only show their emotions through their scent.  This makes them seem alien to those that are unfamiliar with their ways., and makes it more difficult for inter-species communication to occur.

!Hapless Soft Ones
At their core, Saurial view other humanoids with an indifference verging on pity.  Born into the world lacking stout scales and sharp teeth, it's a wonder they have managed to survive for so long.  The typical [[Human]] would barely make it through a day in the jungles.  Still, if other creatures prove useful to the Saurial, those creatures can trigger a protective response made all the stronger by their apparent weakness.  The Saurial assess such beings as hatchlings, young ones incapable of protecting themselves but who might prove useful in the future if they receive care.

Scathe have tough leathery skin, like a snake.  Reptilian in nature, their yellow eyes sense heat and have excellent [[Infravision]] good to a range of 120'.  Scathe are noted to be muted green or brown in color, and just as often milky-white.  Scathe are tribal, and possess rudimentary culture.  It is not quite clear on their level of intelligence.  They scavenge from other races, and have been known to brandish weapons they have acquired during raids.  Considered a nuisance by all other races.

Their communication is rudimentary, consisting of basic howls, grunts and shrieks.  They form into packs which are led by the strongest among them.

Scathe larvae are small worm like creatures with mottled brown skin.  They have a well developed beak when they hatch.  Maturing larvae will have limbs visible under their skin, which they shed when it is outgrown.

{{quote{
//&quot;Work is our joy, long live labor! ''- Seipher Black''//
}}}
Professor at [[The Athenaeum]] who teaches [[Metamagic]] and [[Teleportation]] to upper and lower school students.  He never appears happy, is a killjoy and always depressed.  His serious demeanor has him always focused on study, and he strongly disproves of when others prioritize merriment over work.

He has high expectations of his students, and demands they act and contribute with excellence and determination.  He has a motto &quot;Work Is Our Joy, Long Live Labor&quot; and when he quotes it is the only time he is known to have a visible smile.  He is studious, and known across [[Asha]] for his research in [[Metamagic]].

As a student in [[The Athenaeum]], he excelled at his study and was regarded as one of the best.  He reveled in learning, and poured himself into his work such that he had little to no friends among the other students.  Despite his efforts and the knowledge he gained, he was forever overshadowed by a fellow student named [[Sanders]] - who for reasons unknown to Seipher Black was [[Nester Arkwood's|Nester Arkwood]] favorite.

Sene'Rine'Rada is one of [[The Echo Planes]], housing the spirit of [[Valouria]].  Sene'Rine'Rada is an [[Elvish|Elf]] word, meaning the World Of Dreams.  This dimension is a reflection of the natural world, and everything that happens here to a dreamer is real.  If a person dies in Sene'Rine'Rada, their body dies in the real world.  Along those same lines, people who are wounded here will awaken with the wounds.

The world of Sene'Rine'Rada is malleable; one can project thoughts and create creatures and buildings.  There is always a soft glowing ambient light everywhere, with no apparent source.  One often experiences a constant feeling of unseen eyes watching from every direction while within it.  Time also passes at a different rate, sometimes slow and other times faster than the real world.

Dreamers do not enter Sene'Rine'Rada without the use of [[Dream Walking]], except in rare occasions.  It is possible for an unskilled dreamer to inadvertently find themselves here only for a few seconds before they flicker back to their own private dream.

!The Lost Souls Of Sene'Rine'Rada
There are a loose collection of those who have died deep within Sene'Rine'Rada known as [[The Wayward]].  Forever lost and disconnected from [[The Material Plane]], they seek to enter into the dreams of those who touch this dimension, looking for companionship.  While some have made peace with their situation, many remain restless and yearn again for a physical body and for a world to return to.

!The Dreaming
[[The Dreaming]] are a collection of entities native to Sene'Rine'Rada.  Chief among these are the [[Spren]]: primal and animalistic manifestations that arise from the strong emotions of dreamers.  Their existence is fleeting, most living for but a brief moment, occupying the dreams of one or two visitors before fading away.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/seraph.jpg]]

A Seraph is a race of spiritual [[Extra-Planar|The Planes Of Existence]] entities native to [[The Fountains Of Creation]].  Some cultures refer to these spirits by different names, such as &quot;Genies&quot;, &quot;Djinn&quot;, &quot;Efreeti&quot;, &quot;Dao&quot;, or &quot;Marids&quot;.  They are formed when a [[Soul]] coalesces with the primordial matter of the [[Elemental Planes|The Fountains Of Creation]].  Only under the rarest conditions does this occur, and this has become even more rare after the [[AstraKashira]] enacted [[The Trials Of Judgement]].

!Creatures Of The Elements
A Seraph retains no connection to the [[Soul]] that gave them form.  That life force is a building block that determines the Seraph's form and apparent gender, as well as one or two key personality traits.  They are sentient [[Elementals|Elemental]], with traits that relate to the [[Elemental Plane|The Fountains Of Creation]] to which they were bound.  They are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud as they are majestic.  Haughty and decadent, they have a profound sense of entitlement that stems from the knowledge that few creatures except [[The Gods]] and other Seraph can challenge their power.
When a Seraph perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.

!Service To The Cycle
Each Seraph becomes a slave to [[The Eternal Cycle]], bound and forced to keep the physical world of [[Asha]] and [[The Echo Planes]] spinning.  They control the tides, the wind, the weather, and the rising and setting of the Sun.  They are unable to stray from fulfilling their function, however some Seraph are more dedicated to their tasks than others.  Some see themselves as slaves, and lament their toil; doing what little they can to fulfill their duty.  Others take pleasure in their purpose.

!Jealousy And Power
Seraph acknowledge [[The Gods]] as powerful entities, but have no desire to court or worship them.  They find the endless fawning and mewling of religious devotees tiresome - except if it is directed towards them.  Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their personalities deceive the Seraph into believing they are as powerful as [[The Gods]].  Some go as far as to manipulate and toy with [[The Mortal Races|Races]] to accumulate followers and worshipers; however it is difficult to accomplish given their primary need is to service some natural function.

Shadow dragons are [[true dragons|Dragon]] that were either born in [[The Shadowfell]] or transformed by years spent within its dismal confines.  Some shadow dragons embrace [[The Shadowfell]] for its bleak landscapes and desolation, while others desperately seek to return to [[The Material Plane]].

The transformation to a shadow dragon happens over a period of years, during which time a dragon's scales lose their luster and fade into a charcoal hue.  Its leathery wings become translucent, its eyes paling to pools of opalescent gray.  Shadow dragons find sunlight abhorrent, and they are weaker in bright light than they are in darkness.  Darkness makes the dragon fade to a spectral shadow of its former self.  A shadow dragon is so suffused with the power of [[The Shadowfell]] that even a return to [[The Material Plane]] can't undo its transformation.  Some shadow dragons attempt to lure other creatures from the mortal realm back to [[The Shadowfell]] to keep them company, at least until they tire of their guests and devour them.  Others are happy to leave [[The Shadowfell]] behind forever, understanding that treasure and power are easier to come by in [[The Material Plane]].

<pre>Shadow Holde is an Outpost for [[The Viridian Empire]] setup after [[The War Of The Shores]] in 1008 [[AAP]] to protect from a direct assault by ship by the [[Orcs|Orc]].  It is far within the frontier of [[The Orcish Lands]]; occupied solely by a garrison and those brave enough to withstand living in a barren wasteland to serve the needs of the soldiers stationed here.

The outpost does not have the amenities of a city, and only has a makeshift [[Teleportation Circle]] made of old wood and paint, dusty streets of packed grey dirt, and ramshackle buildings.

A short hike to the east is [[The Boneyard]], an anti-magic zone that attracts all sorts of dangers.

!Areas Of Interest
In truth, the name Shadow Holde was originally the nickname given to the ruins of a [[forgotten hall|Shadow Holde Hall]] dating back to [[The Second Age]].  Built into the sprawling maroon-grey cliff-side of [[The Southspine Peaks]], the [[hall|Shadow Holde Hall]] is comprised of ancient, jet black towers that climb towards the sky and emerge from the rock in multiple places.  The mountains themselves are part of the structure.  The towers have platforms, alcoves, and balconies - some are crumbled, and some still stand.  The thick black gates to [[Shadow Holde Hall]] remain closed; for good measure.  Sounds of unspeakable horrors are heard within.  These ruins tower over the outpost as a constant reminder for the local militia to be on guard.</pre>

//Much uncertainty surrounds the archangel Shalekasha.  Once the calm guiding hand of justice, she was lost to us the moment [[Lucian's Children|Draugaira]] battled [[The Humans|Human]].  Unable to idly witness the death and destruction, she abandoned [[Elysium]] to tip the balance in the favor of the [[Elves|Draugaira]].  Her departure deeply wounded [[The Seven]], a wound that to this day remains unhealed.//
''-[[Serapheal]], writing on Shalekasha''
}}}
Shalekasha (??? - 1026 [[AAP]]) (The Astral Soul, Mother Of Vengance, Queen of [[The Bronze Citadel]]) was an [[AstraKashira]] that came to the aid of the [[Draugaira]] [[Elves|Elf]] in [[The Third Age]] to slay [[The Whispered One]].  Once an [[Archangel]] and leader of [[The Seven]], she fell to become an [[Archdevil]] who ruled over [[The Circle Of Pride|Avernus]] in [[Baator]]; one of [[The Lords Of The Nine]].  Her fall from grace was a tragic one, in which she was captured and corrupted by [[The Whispered One]].  Her [[Soul]] was captured by [[Zezebazum]] in [[Baator]].  To her surprise, she awoke not to an army of [[Dathairä]], but to the promise of a job offer to lead [[Baator]] in a campaign to rid [[Asha]] of [[Blood Magic]].

She was obsessed with stamping out the [[Human]] impulse that gave rise to [[The Whispered One]], and sees herself as using the forces of [[Baator]] to achieve a just and righteous outcome.  She was blinded by zealous fury as much as she was her own pride.  She was reckless and rash in combat, fighting with a fury and resolve that made her a dangerous combatant.  Off the battlefield, she grew to exhibit the same reckless and rash personality, and became cruel and callous in her time as the ruler of [[Avernus]].  She was notorious for her foul temper and poor emotional control which impeded her ability to act rationally and pragmatically.  She refused to play politics, and prefered to charge headfirst into dangerous situations.

[[Zezebazum]] knew her [[Corruption]] would be a boon to his master, [[Azarad-Ji]].  Her position in [[Baator]] was one of his most crowning achievements.  He was able to abuse her fatal flaw: hubris.  [[AstraKashira]] had a sense of infallibility about their actions, and her anger was only further inflamed by the righteousness with which she acted.  [[Zezebazum]] praised her for her strength of convictions, but it was her unbridled rage that had cemented her downfall.  She had become so zealously hell-bent on preventing another rise of [[The Whispered One]] that she was willing to abandon her principles and sacrifice the very innocent lives she had once sworn to protect in order to achieve her goal.

Two [[Draugaira]] [[Paladins|Paladin]] named [[Haurumana]] and [[Olanthiosa]] were stalwart companions of Shalekasha in her fight against [[The Whispered One]].  [[Haurumana]] reluctantly corrupted himself, following loyally in the service of Shalekasha despite reluctance of their path.  [[Olanthiosa]], seeing the [[Corruption]] chose instead to throw himself on his blade; but was resurrected by Shalekasha to serve her in undeath.

[[Lucian]] had gifted Shalekasha with [[Ithronel]], [[The Sword Of Justice]].  The sword refused to serve her in [[Baator]], burning Shalekasha's hands in her fallen state.  She cast the sword away, where the very skin of [[Avernus]] formed over it like a scab that would never heal.

In 1026 [[AAP]], [[Staz Amrius Kafanz]] defeated Shalekasha in single combat.  When she would not yield, and spat upon his offer to redeem herself, he slayed her with sorrow.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/items/combat-styles/shao-lolo-sikili.jpg]]
Shao'loloSikili roughly translates as &quot;The Way Of The Knife&quot;, and is a fighting style focusing on such elements as the awareness of the spirit, alertness, and swiftness. It relies on speed and relaxed leverage rather than brute force.  Perfected by [[Elves|Elf]] during [[The Sylvan Empire]] in [[The Third Age]], it remains prevalent among portions of the [[Variona'Sha]].

''Shao'loloSikili - (Physical/Hard)''
This represents the skill in &quot;The Way Of The Knife&quot;, and allows the character to learn the maneuvers of this style.  Additionally, attacks with knives using this skill grants additional damage to the attack.  Add 1/10 of your Shao'loloSikili skill (rounded down) to knife damage.

''Fleche or &quot;Charge&quot; in [[Elvish]]''
This attack consists of a swift advance to close the distance with the enemy, ending with a thrusting attack with a dagger or knife.  An attack in this maneuver allows the attacker to move one //extra// hex with his Step and Attack maneuver, and do +1 damage.  This bonus applies to thrusting attacks only.  The swift advance leaves the attacker open to counterattacks, granting them -3 on active defense rolls.

''Dringa or &quot;Reply&quot; in [[Elvish]]''
This maneuver is a quick counter-attack after successfully parrying an enemy attack.  It can only be employed with thrusting weapons and hand attacks.  The character can choose to use this maneuver if he has been successfully attacked by a melee attack.  He must Parry the attack; if successful, he can instantly attack (or Feint) at -4.  The enemy is at -1 to defend (he is still recovering from the attack), and at an additional -1 for every point by which the Parry was successful (do not count Passive Defense bonuses).

''Rhassa or &quot;Whirlwind&quot; in [[Elvish]]''
This maneuver consists of a quick pivot of the body resulting in a spinning attack with a weapon.  The intended result of the sudden shift in the attack's center of gravity is to surprise the enemy, but an experienced martial artist is not likely to be fooled by it.
The maneuver allows a simultaneous Feint and attack.  The attacker must roll twice.  First, roll a Quick Contest of Rhassa vs the opponent's weapon skill (or Brawling, Karate, DX if unarmed).  Then roll a second time to deliver the attack.  If the Feint was successful, use the Feinting rules on p. B96 to determine the enemy's defense penalties.  However, if the defender wins the contest, he gets a //bonus// equal to the amount by which he won the contest;  the attack was badly delivered and the attacker &quot;telegraphed&quot; the attack, making it easier to defend.

''Dual Weapon Attack (Hard)''
The attacker may strike with two weapons //at once//, at the same foe or two adjacent ones.  Each weapon is at -4, in addition to any off-hand and hit location penalties.  Such attacks are difficult to defend against if aimed at a single foe.  The defender's attention is divided: -1 to defend against each attack of a Dual-Weapon Attack aimed at a sole opponent.  This applies to any number of attacks made with paired weapons.</pre>

Simea Opalbraid is a formidable [[Duergar'Ran]] matron who is the enigmatic proprietor of [[The Double Bubble Flower Fresh]] laundry service.  Nestled within the tapestry of [[Tszanthus's|Tszanthus]] [[Lower Streap|The Lower Streap]], she is known to have a hard and tough demeanor.  While outwardly her business is a laundry service, underneath lies a complex web of intrigue, power, and criminal affiliations.

Simea has the distinctive gray skin and white hair of her [[Duergar'Ran]] heritage, her long hair often held in a tight bun atop her stern face.  Her age has only enhanced her authoritative demeanor, commanding both respect and fear in equal measure.  Notorious for her disdain towards men, Simea's reputation for harboring such biases has garnered her a certain level of notoriety within [[The Lower Streap]].  Whether due to past experiences or personal beliefs, her matriarchal leanings have further solidified her role as a leader within her establishment.

While she performs a significant amount of legitimate business, the laundry is actually owned by [[The Brotherhood]] and used as a means for contraband to be moved throughout the city hidden inside of the laundry.</pre>

Sirina Lakshay is a hired guard for [[The Grey Companions]]. She is exotic and beautiful, and handy with the dual scimitars she wears at her side. She adorns herself with traditional [[Uskardeen]] jewelry, and speaks with a slight accent. She is known to have a bad temper, and be extraordinarily paranoid.

Sirina has skill in impersonations and acting.  She has the ability to counterfeit moods, emotions and voices, and to lie convincingly over a period of time.  She can also use makeup and clothing to pass as someone else - making it easy for her to disguise herself.

She speaks with flowery [[Uskardeen]] sayings that are foreign to the ears of many in [[Brand]], such as &quot;If you join the dance circle, you must dance&quot;, &quot;The camel does not see her own hump&quot; and &quot;You drown in a spoon of water&quot;.  When greeting or saying goodbye, she speaks the [[Uskardeen]] phrase &quot;Be Pleased&quot; and offers a deep bow.

Sirina gets very irritated when men act sexist, or presume women are less than men.  She values strength and fortitude, and admires [[Desini Orosco]] and [[Minerva Carrington]] for their power and confidence.

When Sirina has a goal or mission, there are no limits to the extent she will go in order to see it completed.  This translates to her fighting style, which shows no mercy and seeks to defeat her opponent with sheer force, determination and speed.  Her first assignment for [[The Grey Companions]] was to guard the door to the basement, where [[Sathric]] hibernated.  As he appeared as a fellow [[Uskardeen]], Sirina was drawn to him.  His strange mannerisms, shady story of his background, and endless hours spent alone in his room cause her great suspicion.  It will only be a matter of time before she finds out his secret.

Slobodon is extremely strong and virile, and is fond of great bear hugs when meeting close friends.  He has a strong baritone voice, and a casual practitioner of [[The Way]].  He has three deep scars across his left eye that has left it blind, and he refuses to talk about the circumstances by which he received the wound.

!The Jackal Of Jakkah
Slobodon is known as &quot;The Jackal Of Jakkah&quot;, and carries a moderate amount of respect and power across the underworld of the city.  He is a smuggler, dealing in the narcotic known as [[Dew]] which when commonly drank within hot tea grants [[Metamagic]] features to spellcasters.  He is a shrewd [[Souk]], and unlike those in his trade, despises haggling.  This is especially true when dealing with contraband and difficult to get items.
Along with contraband, Slobodon is a dealer in antiquities.  Artifacts and potions of history, with rare and mysterious properties forgotten by mortal men.  This appreciation for history came from his friendship with [[Alastair Neron]].  </pre>

[&gt;img[images/magic/sorcery.jpg]]
[[Magic]] is an innate part of every Sorcerer, suffusing body, mind and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped.  They are born with this connection, deep within their blood.
Across [[Asha]], the [[Races|Race]] of [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], [[Elves|Elf]], [[Dragonborn]] and [[Tiefling]] contain strong bloodlines of Sorcery; a spark kindled from their [[races’|Races]] origins.  However Sorcerers can be of any race; through either an unlocked ancestral trait that lay dormant for centuries or a genetic ability passed through generations.

!Raw Magic
Sorcerers have no use for spell books, ancient tomes of magic lore, arcane foci, or spell components.  They are a living conduits of [[Mana]], shaping the weave of magic to suit their whims with an inborn talent.  They “feel” [[Mana]] as others feel the radiance of the sun or smell an impending rain shower.  
The raw connection to [[Mana]] allows a Sorcerer to be extremely creative with their casting, controlling subtle nuances that turn the act of magic into an art form rather than a science.  While Sorcerers can learn from one another, styles and approaches to harnessing [[Mana]] differ greatly.  [[Wizards|Wizardry]] and Sorcerers, despite both being arcane casters manipulating [[Mana]], differ so greatly in their approach that it is nearly impossible for a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] and Sorcerer to learn from one another, like a bird trying to teach a fish to fly.

!The Weave And The Dance
Each Sorcerer has a natural affinity towards a raw primordial element that the universe was built upon, granted to them by their bloodline.  These elements are Fire, Earth, Water, Air, Time, and [[Mana]].  Harnessing and channeling the power of the universe is a delicate skill, manipulated through certain martial styles that are reminiscent of the qualities of the primordial element itself.  The Sorcerer weaves [[Mana]] through a performance of large sweeping gestures and motions of their hands and feet, quite literally weaving [[Mana]] into shapes and effects.

!Control, Alter, Sense, Elemental
There are four categories of power in which all Sorcery is classified.  ''Control'' of ones physical and mental self, the ability to ''Alter'' the very reality one lives within, extending ones ''Sense'' and perception, and harnessing the universe’s ''Elemental'' force.

!Sorcerer Bloodlines
There are six identified bloodlines with innate sorcery.
* ''(Constitution/Earth)'' [[Dwarven Bloodlines|Dwarven Bloodline]] have a special connection with the earth.  This bloodline focuses on standing ones ground, absorbing or intercepting attacks, and constitution.
* ''(Strength/Fire)'' [[Demonic Bloodlines|Demonic Bloodline]] derive from the [[Dathairä]], who channel with strength and fire.  It is understood that this style is fueled by hatred and wrath, and weaves created by these sorcerers are bold, powerful, and strong. 
* ''(Wisdom/Water)'' [[Fey Bloodlines|Fey Bloodline]] have elemental control over water.  This style is focused on fluidity, and turning an opponents energy upon themselves.  Practitioners focus on inward searching for wisdom, and their elemental control requires acceptance of fluid change.
* ''(Dexterity/Air)'' [[Draconic Bloodlines|Draconic Bloodline]] have an affinity for the element of air.  The style is focused on speed, evasion, and dexterous movements.
* ''(Intelligence/Time)'' [[Celestial Bloodlines|Celestial Bloodline]] are those touched by an [[Elysian]] or one of [[The Elder Gods]].  They gain a small amount of control over time itself.  Intelligence and understanding are at the heart of the style, requiring one to give in to and embrace the paradox and complexities of the universe.
* ''(Charisma/Chaos)'' [[Wild Bloodlines|Wild Bloodline]] are children of unbridled chaos, with the ability to tap into immense power that underlies the order of creation.  They lack the ability to control their power in the way the other bloodlines can.  This bloodline is rare, as it is difficult for one to survive the bodily punishmenti nherent to channeling such power.</pre>

The Sorrowsworn are malevolent entities native to [[The Shadowfell]], embodying the realm's pervasive sense of despair and malice.  These creatures are humanoid in shape but twisted into a grotesque form that reflects the torment of [[Valouria]].  With long, spindly limbs and a gaunt physique, the Sorrowsworn are a terrifying sight, their very presence seeping dread into the hearts of those unfortunate enough to encounter them.

Their skin is a pallid, ashen grey, stretched tight over their bones, and is cold to the touch.  Their heads are elongated, with skull-like features that included hollowed cheekbones and large, black, soulless eyes that dominate their face.  They are completely hairless, other than long grey wisps that grow on top of their heads.  Their fingers end in sharp, claw-like nails that allow them to climb walls and ceilings with ease.

They are driven by an insatiable hunger for despair and suffering.  They are drawn to negative emotions like a moth to flame, feeding off the anguish and fear of their victims.  Their movements are eerily silent, allowing them to stalk their prey with unsettling patience, much like a spider lying in wait for its next meal.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/items/artifacts/soul-coin.jpg]]
Soul Coins are artifacts forged in [[Dis]], The Second Circle of [[Baator]].  They are about 5 inches across and about an inch thick, minted from [[Infernal Iron]].  Each coin weighs one third of a pound, and is inscribed with [[Infernal]] writing and a spell that magically binds a single [[Soul]] in the coin.  Because each coin has a unique [[Soul]] trapped within it, each has a story.  A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a curse.
To hold a Soul Coin is to feel the [[Soul]] bound within it - overcome with rage or fraught with despair.  An evil creature can carry as many Soul Coins as it wishes.  A non-evil creature can carry a number of Soil Coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty.  Carrying more grants disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
Each coin has three charges.  When in contact with the coin, a charge can be expended to:
Drain Life: siphon away some of the [[Soul's|Soul]] essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.
Query: telepathically ask the [[Soul]] a question and receive a brief telepathic answer.  The [[Soul]] only knows what it knew in life, and must answer truthfully and to the best of its ability.  The answer is no more than a sentence or two and may be cryptic.
Using the final charge destroys the coin and the [[Soul]] within.  Soul Coins are used as currency in [[Baator]], and highly valued by those that live there.  The value of the coin is tarnished if charges have been consumed.
It is possible to free a [[Soul]] trapped within a coin using powerful [[Magic]] in the form of a Greater Restoration spell.  The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed - releasing the [[Soul]] into the plane of existence it belongs.  Evil [[Souls|Soul]] find themselves emerging once again in [[Baator]] as a [[Soul Larvae]].</pre>

The Soulfiends were constructs of the necromancer [[Teldinath Dagon]] in what is known as [[The Demon Plague]].  The [[ritual|Blood Magic Rituals]] for channeling and creating a Soulfiend was quite complex, however the vessel must be a willing participant for the spell to succeed.  Once complete, the Soulfiend gave it's host an incredible boost of Strength (+6 Strength), Dexterity (+4 Dexterity) and speed (+20 feet of movement), and were very hard to kill (Soulfiends regenerate 1 hitpoint / turn).  They had the power to rip the [[Soul]] out of a human victim once per long rest, by slowly reaching their hands within the victim's head.  While the procedure of extracting a [[Soul]] was painful to the victim, it left no external scar or blemish.  The victim would regress into a drooling mindless state (Treat as a Feeblemind spell).  The Soulfiends require [[Souls|Soul]] to survive (treat as a dependency) or the demon inhabiting the host suffers from the Feeblemind spell themselves.</pre>

Sphinx are a form of [[Archon]], or spirits created by [[Qualok]].  They guard the secrets and treasures of [[The Gods]].  As it calmly regards each new party that comes before it, the bones of supplicants and quest seekers that failed to pass its tests lie scattered around its lair.  Its great wings sweep along its flanks, its tawny leonine body rippling with muscle and possessed of forepaws powerful enough to tear a humanoid in half.

They are diving guardians, who test the worth of those who seek them.  A sphinx maintains its vigil tirelessly, not needing to sleep or eat.  It rarely engages with others of its kind, knowing no other life except its sacred mission.

!Known Sphinxes
[[Anku Isetarri Kemat]] - Sphinx under [[The Temple Of The Divine]] in [[Deepwater]]
[[Petemet Anebos Bekanamen]] - Sphinx under [[The Tomb Of The Radiant Guard]] in [[The Boneyard]]
[[Oluket Ramara Khonsu]] - Sphinx that guards [[Alyxian's|Alyxian]] place of rest in [[Amon]]

<pre>Spren are entities found in [[Sene'Rine'Rada]], made manifest out of strong emotions of dreamers.  They are a one class of entity that make up [[The Dreaming]].  Some are created from love and hope, while others out of fear and anger.

!A Fleeting Existence
Most Spren live for only a brief moment, occupying the dreams of one or two visitors before fading away.  They require strong emotions to thrive.  There are some, however, who have learned to prey on the visiting dreamers; surviving by influencing the dreamer.  They are powerful creatures that use [[Sene'Rine'Rada]] as their playground.

!Speechless
Spren do not speak, and it is assumed they are incapable; however, their behavior is mysterious and demonstrates a vast intellect.  Communication with others who are not part of [[The Dreaming]] is done through shaping the environment around them.  Despite their apparent lack of vocal communication, Spren have a profound impact on the dreams of those they visit.  They can alter the dreamer's surroundings and create intricate dreamscapes that are both beautiful and terrifying.

!Known Spren
[[Nabras]] - a chaotic and capricious entity who had made a deal with the [[Archfey]] [[Lady Velisene]], and in return can speak with a voice
[[Alioth]] - a manifestation of fear, who continues to thrive within [[Sene'Rine'Rada]]; an entity that gains power when disastrous events shake the world of [[Asha]]</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/kellos/the-northlands/staz-amrius-kafanz.jpg]]

Staz Amrius Kafanz (c. 1008 [[AAP]] to Current) was a player character run by [[Tyler Disbrow]].  He is the [[Apotheon]] of GLORY, LIGHT, and ORDER and he fights a holy war against [[Baator]].  His childhood was one of pain and torment.  Staz was born into [[slavery|Slave]], from two [[Orc]] parents captured from [[The War Of The Shores]] (in 1008 AAP).  Both parents were warriors of [[The Stormreaver Clan]], fierce fighters known for their berserker rage and animalistic ferocity.  Staz was born in the heat of battle; his mother, [[Kiznakh]], giving birth while swinging her dual hand axes and taking the life of many foes.  He was forcibly separated from his mother as an infant, and never knew his parents.  The level of ferocity in which he fought against his slave owners labeled him worthless and “untamable” as a [[Slave]], and Staz was taken to the arena for fodder.  It was [[Gravis Somandre]] who purchased him for the sum of 8 silver for his [[Gladiator]] [[Ludis]].

!The Gladiator
While undisciplined and wild, [[Somandre|Gravis Somandre]] honed this fighting spirit for the glory of the games of [[Bandor]].  Staz showed disdain for the other [[Gladiators|Gladiator]] and was combative with [[Somandre|Gravis Somandre]] and his lieutenant, [[Malchior]].  Staz's first event in the arena was won through sheer strength and determination rather than prowess.  The crowd remembers that Staz never showed fear in the arena, not even in his first fight.
The sands of [[The Amphitheater]] of [[Bandor]] became Staz's playground, and the crowd loved him for what he offered.  He rose to become the most skilled, athletic, and durable of [[Somandre's|Gravis Somandre]] [[Gladiators|Gladiator]].  He draw the largest crowds, and was guaranteed to please.  Most of his fights were simply for show or entertainment, without death or killing.  [[Malchior]] taught Staz the art of performance; how to draw out the fight to create dramatic displays for the entertainment of the onlookers.  However, not all fights were for enjoyment - and the sands of [[Bandor's arena|The Amphitheater]] were also used for the execution of criminals.  It was the grotesqueness of [[Orcish|Orc]] heritage that caused the crowd to demand that Staz be the executioner.  They labeled him &quot;The Beast&quot;, which he embraced with the name Staz ([[Black Speech]] for &quot;beast&quot;).  Staz took no joy from slaying criminals, most had no experience in combat and simply scurried and begged, fear wide in their eyes.  Taking their lives was physically easy when the primal rage welled up inside of him.

!Freedom Achieved
One day [[Gravis Somandre]] informed the [[Ludis]] that [[Emperor]] [[Galad Jedaleon]] had abolished slavery, and all of the [[Gladiators|Gladiator]] were free.  [[Somandre|Gravis Somandre]] offered Staz a place in the [[Ludis]], as a paid [[Gladiator]]; but Staz had his fill of blood.  Life was harder on the streets of [[Bandor]], and he soon found himself in a small hostel run by a blind priest named [[Ezekiel]], who established the hostel to care for the recent outpouring of freed [[slaves|Slave]].  Staz began to pray for guidance, aid, or simply a sign as what to do next.  It was here that Staz found his calling as a [[Paladin]] and befriended the [[Bard]] [[Wyanne Loom]].  Together they joined with an [[Elf]] [[Druid]] named [[ElethaNori]] and a [[Human]] [[Warlock]] named [[Aereon Zara Al-Wali]], naming themselves [[The Travelers]].

!The Apotheon
Gifted with the powers of an [[Apotheon]] from [[Valouria]], Staz began to course with newfound power.  His domains are GLORY, LIGHT, and ORDER.  He seeded an order of [[Orcish|Orc]] [[Paladins|Paladin]] known as [[The Theocracy]] who were as devout as they were strong.  Together with his army of [[Paladins|Paladin]] and his [[AstraKashira]] [[Patron]] [[Amrius]], they besieged [[Avernus]] and Staz retrieved [[Ithronel]], [[The Sword Of Justice|Ithronel]] which once was gifted to [[Shalekasha]] by [[Lucian]] herself.  It lay deep within [[Avernus]], covered by an evil scab to quell its radiant light.  Wielding [[Ithronel]], Staz defeated the fallen [[AstraKashira]] [[Shalekasha]], the current [[Duke]] of [[Avernus]], in single combat.  When she would not yield, and would not redeem herself; he slayed her with sorrow.

Staz and his army hold a precarious position in [[Avernus]], controlling the flying fortress of [[The Bronze Citadel]] which is a symbol of oppression and the typical seat of power of the [[Duke]] of [[Avernus]].  Where it once was covered in blood and grime, it now gleams as a beacon to all who perceive it; a shining light in a realm of darkness.  The [[Dathairä]] plot and scheme however, and it is only a matter of time before Staz and his army are dislodged from their stronghold and barred from [[Avernus]] forever.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/bestiary/the-shadowfell/stirge.jpg]]

A Stirge is a tiny flying creature from [[The Shadowfell]].  They resemble a monstrous cross between a large bat and an oversized mosquito.  Their wingspan reaches a length of up to 1 foot across, with males and females having an outwardly similar appearance.  Stirge feed on blood using a long needle-like proboscis, they prefer the blood of sentient creatures.

Newborn stirges are only capable of gliding, not flying and spend the first four months of their lives being carried on their mother's back.  Stirge mothers are capable of carrying up to two of their young.

Stirges have an average animal-level intelligence.  The scent of blood draws them near.  When adults form into swarms, they become ravenous for blood - feeding capitalistically on their weakest members when blood supply runs low.  When in a swarm, the Stirge become highly aggressive and have been responsible for the extinction of life within pockets of [[The Shadowfell]].  Swarms are known to be lethal, and are exterminated like vermin.</pre>

<pre>|Governor:|[[Dorn Stomgar]], [[Dwarf]], [[Shield]] of Stomgar's Quarry and [[Bannerman]] of [[House Eulien]]|
|Population:|4,000-6,000, 80% [[Human]], 20% [[Dwarf]]|
|Fortifications:|The city is built on the fertile floor of a massive canyon.  Large cliffs and mountains naturally defend it.  There are ensconces along the canyon walls allowing archers to serve as snipers in times of distress.  There is only one clear pass through the mountains that leads to Stomgar Quarry|
|Law:|100 guardsman|
|Resources:|Precious metals, gemstones, stonecutting (they have fantastic quarries that produce many types of stone), [[Bitterbrew]] (strong [[Dwarvish|Dwarf]] ale – said to be the best version ever made on the surface of [[Asha]])|

!Description
The city is built within a canyon beside the ruins of an [[Elven city|The Sylvan Empire]] that was originally built within the cliff face.  Ruins and small paths can still be found here.  [[Dorn’s|Dorn Stomgar]] grandfather, [[Dain Stomgar]], ran a quarry within the fertile canyon under the banner of [[House Eulien]].  He was quite successful and a few other [[clans|Dwarven Clans]] surfaced and took part in the profitable venture.  Eventually [[Humans]] settled here, chasing after the [[Dwarves’|Dwarf]] prosperity.

!Social Customs
* Once a year the city holds a competition which has contestants jump from [[The Leap’s|The Leap]] crest, and diving down the length of the canyon into the deep pool at the foot.  The dive is not for the faint of heart, or for those that are not accomplished divers.
* [[Kombar’Ran|Dwarf]] are prevalent in the city.  They are concentrated within a small suburb in which they retain their native language and culture, few [[Kombar'Ran|Dwarf]] in the district bother to learn the [[Human]] tongue.  The two conflicting cultures within the city often causes trouble or sources of intolerance and racism.

He does not want to be [[Lord]] or any such nonsense, but it does pay well.  He gets by without running the city by personally appointing people to positions of authority that handle all the mundane activities.  His charismatic herald, [[Morgan Kane]], also helps him.  He and [[Morgan Kane]] are good friends but total opposites at the same time.  The thing that [[Dorn Stomgar]] hates most about being [[Lord]] is the popularity and status attached to the position.  He loathes public attention and lack of a private life.|

[[Morgan|Morgan Kane]] is responsible for [[Dorn’s|Dorn Stomgar]] appearance and transforms the uncouth [[Dwarf]] into a respectful [[Lord]].

*[[The Leap]] is a rather magnificent cascade of waterfalls that stretches from the top of the canyon to the canyon floor.  It is the falls, and the lake it creates that keeps the valley fertile and lush.
*[[Kombar’s Eye]] is yet another [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] run tavern.  It serves the darkest [[Bitterbrew]] and its proprietor is known to lead the patrons in a loud drunken chorus (usually old ballads of battle).
*[[Stomgar’s Holdfast]] is a magnificent [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] built structure built directly into the cliff face.  [[Kombar’ran|Dwarf]] often see the building as tacky, often wondering why the whole structure wasn’t built underground.
*[[The Order’s Alms]] is a hospital run by [[Derik Tippet]], a local priest and healer, who wishes to mend the hurts of the Quarry’s townfolk.  The hospital is a place for one to go if they need to heal they wounds, or their souls.

<pre>Strongholds are cities of the [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] people, often built into mountains or underground.  They are governed by a [[Dorn]] (translation from [[Dwarvish]]: &quot;King&quot;), and house thousands of [[Dwarves|Dwarf]].  Each Stronghold is a free city ruled by the [[Dorn]], who sets rules and laws for the Stronghold.  All Strongholds obey the word of [[Kombar]], and are devout followers of [[The Undermountain Papacy]].  Each Stronghold has a religious leader known as a [[Kestaz]] (translation: &quot;Holy&quot;) who is the mouthpiece of [[Kombar]].  He holds as much influence and power as the [[Dorn]], as he commands the [[Volg'gogan]], or &quot;the stone blessed&quot; - who are both priests and able to channel the [[Divine Favor]] of [[Kombar]].

Other important roles within the Stronghold include the [[Keluz'rond]] or &quot;Strongshield&quot; captain, who is the leader of the military.  It is their responsibility to protect the Stronghold in times of war, but also keep the peace.  The [[Taurak'talomar]] or &quot;Trade Master&quot; handles logistics of trade and settles disputes among merchants.  It is the trade master who ensures relationships with nearby towns and settlements are kept healthy.  The [[Volg'talomar]] or &quot;Stone Master&quot; leads mining operations for the Stronghold.  This includes planning mining expeditions, and ensuring a constant flow of ore.

[[Dwarven|Dwarf]] society is clan based, and each clan has a leader or representative.  This includes both family clans, as well as guilds such as blackmiths, brewers, and craftsdwarves.</pre>

<div title="Stygia" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202212282107" modified="202408112349" tags="location Baator" changecount="27">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/baator/stygia/stygia.jpg]]
The Circle Of Chains, or more commonly known as Stygia is the fifth layer of [[Baator]]. It is ruled by [[Belphagor]], Dark Tyrant of [[The Gazath Throne]], Lord of [[Arnadoth]]. Stygia is a prison realm, where [[Souls|Soul]] are tormented in a confinement of their own making. Here can be found the unfit of [[Baator]] and the enemies of [[Azarad-Ji]]; bound for eternity. The prison is inescapable, and even [[Dathairä]] dislike being here.

!The Unfit Of Baator
[[Souls|Soul]] who do not fit within the mold of [[Baator]] will soon find themselves in the agonizing realm of Stygia.  While [[Baator]] values wicked [[Souls|Soul]], there exist infractions which make it impossible to fit into the structure and hierarchy imposed by the [[Dathairä]].  Most creatures who led a life of good but failed to reach the high standards of [[The Trials Of Judgement]] simply conform to the depraved ways of [[Baator]].  There exist a few, however, who resist; those who seek redemption or repent from their evil ways.  Even a small amount of good within the soul pollutes [[Baator]], and they are taken to Stygia for the torment of [[The Prison Of Ash]].  Years of torture either reforms the [[Soul]] into one fitting of [[Baator]], or breaks them enough to be minted as [[Soul Coins|Soul Coin]].
Ambition is rewarded in [[Baator]], as it is required to advance. However failed ambition is unacceptable, and any who find their ambition greater than their ability find themselves in Stygia.

!Geography
Before [[The Trials Of Judgement]], and [[Souls|Soul]] entered into [[Baator]], Stygia was the upper most and oldest realm.  At that time, [[Baator]] only had five layers: [[Stygia]], [[Malbolge]], [[Maladomini]], [[Cania]], and [[Nessus]].  It is through Stygia which [[Dathairä]] enter and leave [[Baator]], and where their essence returns if they were to die.  Stygia is littered with abandoned architecture from when the realm once flourished with [[Dathairä]], [[Belphagor]] resides within a citadel known as [[Arnadoth]]; once the palace of [[Azarad-Ji]].  He proudly sits upon [[The Gazath Throne]], once the seat of power for [[Azarad-Ji]] himself until he built a bigger and more fortified position within [[Nessus]]. The layers above Stygia are held aloft by a thick chain known as [[The Spine]].  Those layers grow like a tumor from this chain, in the same fashion by which a [[Dathairä]] is reformed in [[The Kiln Of The Profaned]].  [[Souls|Soul]] are tormented in the crypts beneath the wastelands of the realm, in what is known as [[The Prison Of Ash]].

!The Prison Of Ash
Those that are confined within [[The Prison Of Ash]] (also known as Tartarus) wait their turn in cells to be tortured to death.  They hear the screams of the other prisoners, each being subjected to a personalized torment which ends their life.  The bodies are piled and burned when all are dead.  The burning hell fire is so bright that it illuminates [[Malbolge]] through great pits that dot the landscape, causing [[Malbolge's|Malbolge]] day and night cycle.  Death is not an escape, and the prisoners find themselves waking again within their cell the next day.  It is an effective and proven system specifically designed to break one's mind.
The prison is tended to by [[Dathairä]] known as [[Kyton]] or &quot;Chain Devils&quot;.  They are former [[Souls|Soul]] or [[Dathairä]] who have been turned into mindless creatures who obey only [[Belphagor]].  Their bodies are covered in heavy chains which they wear like a cloak and wield as a weapon.  They typically keep their throat and mouth free of chains, and sometimes a single eye.  What parts of the body one does see can take the guise of a loved one, to unnerve their victims.

!The Citadel Of Arnadoth
[[The Citadel Of Arnadoth]] is the residence of [[Belphagor]].  He lives alone, secluded in his vast fortress; the only sounds the occasional scream from [[The Lair Of Laskyar]] which lies beneath [[The Citadel|The Citadel Of Arnadoth]].  [[The Lair Of Laskyar]] is a dungeon for the most vile, most dangerous of Stygia's prisoners.  Ones that require [[Belphagor's|Belphagor]] personal attention.  It's occupants are numerous and notable: [[Belphagor's|Belphagor]] [[Hag]] mother [[Melusina]], Stygia's prior [[Duke]] [[Drazgazel]], the [[AstraKashira]] [[Peniel]], and [[Azarad-Ji's|Azarad-Ji]] traitorous pet named [[Laskyar]] who was the first to attempt to overtake [[Zezebazum]] in their master's absence.

Any [[Dathairä]] who dies find themselves being reformed within [[The Kiln Of The Profaned]], deep within [[The Citadel Of Arnadoth]].  Reforming from death is a painful and lengthy process, one that requires the consumption of many [[Soul Coins|Soul Coin]].  [[Dathairä]] keep a deposit of coins within [[Dis]] as an insurance measure, as a lack of [[Coins|Soul Coin]] means reforming as a [[Soul Larvae]].

!Places Of Interest
* [[The Kiln Of The Profaned]] is a nursery of sorts, where [[Dathairä]] who have died are reformed.
* [[The Citadel Of Arnadoth]] is [[Azarad-Ji's|Azarad-Ji]] former seat of power, now home to [[Belphagor]]
* [[The Prison Of Ash]] is the location where good aligned or chaotic [[Souls|Soul]] are confined and tortured.
* [[The Field Of Chains]]
* [[The Pit Of Souls]] is the stairway to [[Malbolge]], accessible only through [[The Citadel Of Arnadoth]].
* [[The Spine]] is the thick chain from which the upper layers of [[Baator]] grow from.</pre>

The raising of the island brought with it the Tabaxi's freedom from slavery.  Most left their homeland only to become wandering outcasts.
They are cat-like in appearance, with fur covered bodies, long tails, and retractable claws.  Their fur ranges from a variety of colors and patterns common to cats, leopards, and lions.  While uncommon, some males grow a mane of hair around their head like a lion.

!Wandering Outcasts
Most Tabaxi have fled their homeland of [[Caldoria]], seeking a new life free from slavery and subjugation by the [[Dragonborn]].  They find themselves unwelcome in most cities, and become homeless wanderers.  This suits their natural curiosity for stories, artifacts, and lore.  Their persisted ancestral slavery allows them to tolerate living within the cracks of civilization; sleeping within alleys, eating among the refuse, and begging for coin.

!Barterers Of Lore
The Tabaxi treasure knowledge rather than material things.  A chest filled with gold coins might be useful to buy food or a coil of rope, but it's not interesting.  In the Tabaxi's eyes, gathering wealth is like packing rations for a long trip.  It's important to survive in the world, but not worth fussing about.
Instead, Tabaxi value knowledge and new experiences.  Their ears perk up in a busy tavern, and they tease out stories with offers of food, drink, and coin.  Tabaxi might walk away with empty purses, but they mull over the stories and rumors they collected like a miser counting coins.
Although material wealth holds little attraction for the Tabaxi, they have an insatiable desire to find and inspect ancient relics, magical items, and other rare objects.  Aside from the power such items might confer, a Tabaxi takes great joy in unraveling the stories behind their creation and the history of their use.

!Fleeting Fancies
Wandering Tabaxi are mercurial creatures, trading one obsession or passion for the next as the whim strikes.  A Tabaxi's desire burns bright, but once met it disappears to be replaced with a new obsession.  Objects remain intriguing only as long as they still hold secrets.
A Tabaxi Rogue might happily spend months plotting to steal a strange gem from a noble, only to trade it for passage on a ship or a week's lodging after stealing it and uncovering it's secrets.  They might take extensive notes or memorize every facet of the gem before passing it on, but the gem itself holds no more allure once its secrets and nature have been laid bare.

!For The Pride
Tabaxi are social creatures, collecting into clans known as [[Prides|Pride]].  The females form the core of this social group and tend to remain in the same [[Pride]] from birth until death.  As a result of remaining in the same pride throughout their lifetimes, female Tabaxi within the same [[Pride]] are generally related to one another.  Due to this permanence, the Tabaxi [[Pride]] is most commonly matriarchal in structure.

Talisonovar Fellbranch (944 [[AAP]] - Current) (1186 [[Hassomir]] - current), more commonly known as Tally to her friends is a prominent figure in [[Dragontail Alley]] of [[Tszanthus'|Tszanthus]] [[Lower Streap|The Lower Streap]].  Tally's early years were a blend of [[Elven|Elf]] and [[Human]] cultures.  Her mother, a talented artisan, instilled in Tally a profound love for shaping and crafting wood.  Her father, a skilled mason, introduced her to the world of stonework, and Tally took to it with a fervor, quickly becoming adept at crafting intricate stonemasonry.

Despite her remarkable skills and inherent artistic talents, life in [[The Lower Streap]] was no easy feat.  Tally faced numerous challenges, from the economic struggles of her family, to the harsh realities of the district.  However, these early hardships deeply affected Tally's upbringing and instilled in her a resilience that remains a driving force in her life.

!The Bent Nail
Tally now carries the torch for her family's legacy as the proprietor of [[The Bent Nail]].  While the shop is known for quality workmanship, she struggles to make ends meet and keep the business afloat.  This is less to do with Tally's skill and more to do with woodworking and wood products in general being scarce and falling out of fashion with the locals of [[Tszanthus]].

!Faithful Of Valouria
Tally is also a devoted follower of [[Valouria]] and [[The Old Faith]].  She often donates a portion of her meager earnings to the local chapter and actively participates in religious ceremonies to honor [[Valouria]], who is associated with the cycles of nature, growth and the importance of persevering through difficult times.</pre>

Tar Barog (meaning &quot;The Navel Of The Oerth&quot; in [[Old Oeridian]]) was the capital city of [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]].  It housed the palace complex of [[Ammenon]], serving as his personal home.  Construction lasted 14 years, and required more than a million workers.  While destroyed at the end of the reign of [[The Whispered One]], it is assumed to be in the desolate region of [[Amon]] known as [[The Glasslands]], near the shore of a salt lake [[Udrukankar]].

At the center of Tar Barog is a circle of stone.  An artifact of sorts, more than a mile across.  Physically, it's a series of five concentric stone circles made of smooth, white pillars of unknown rock durable enough to withstand almost any force - even the one that eradicated its parent city.  Not just withstand it, but remain completely unscathed by the passage of time.  No scars, no weathering, and even no tool marks.

It must have been a great work to transport the pillars, which are some 40 feet high each, to their present site.  There is no rock of that sort within more than 200 miles, and indeed the origin of the stone is not known.

The stone circles are built upon the conjunction of ley-lines, and must have drawn great power from them.</pre>

Tarmon Gellius (c. 1868 [[IO]] to 1812 [[IO]]) was the [[Amonite]] leader who sailed an army from [[Amon]] to [[Kellos]] in 1847 [[IO]], nearly 3000 years ago and tamed the savage land.  He spent most of his years in the unprecedented military campaign known as [[The Amoni Invasion]], helping create one of [[the largest empires in the world|The Amoni Empire]] for his [[Emperor]] [[Nicomedian Trier]].  He was undefeated in battle, and is considered one of the most successful military commanders ever to have lived.

[[The Grey Companions]], an adventuring band within [[The Stone Lands]] began as Tarmon's elite guard.  They were tasked with protecting him and his family.

In 1846 [[IO]], [[Nicomedian Trier]] died.  As the [[Emperor]] neglected to keep a firm rule over the vast extend of [[The Amoni Empire]], it crumbled into multiple successor [[Polités|Polité]].  Tarmon Gellius was declared [[King]] of [[Kellos]], and he severed ties with [[Amon]].  He ruled with absolute authority, and was a commanding presence.

Tarmon Gellius contributed much to the culture of the realms, beginning construction of [[The Westron Wall]] and introducing currency in the form of minting [[Red Queens]].

Upon his death in 1812 [[IO]], his son [[Mendos Gellius]] rose to power following a bloody battle of succession.</pre>

Tarmon Gellius II (c. 1799 [[IO]] - c. 1775 [[IO]]) was the last [[King]] of [[Kellos]].  He is remembered as &quot;The Frail King&quot; both for his physical ailments as well as his failings as a ruler.  He suffered from both Epilepsy and Hemophilia, and was therefore unable to be very active.  He sequestered himself away in his castle for protection, where he governed with a cruel demeanor.

Most notably he executed prominent heads of state (his own kin) as he felt they were mocking him.  This left a large power vacuum in what are now known as [[The Dales]] and [[The Green Sea]].  This combined with the decline of [[The Amoni Empire]] created the climate in which a quick and sudden political action saw him removed from office and [[A Republic|The Old Republic]] put in his place with shared rule among the major noble houses.  It is said he died while in custody, in prison the same year he was deposed.</pre>

A Teleportation Circle is a [[Magic]] incantation by [[Wizards|Wizardry]], allowing the crossing of great distances in an instant.  [[Wizards|Wizardry]] may cast the spell, transporting them to a permanent Teleportation Circle that they are aware of.

Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines.

[[Wizards|Wizardry]] may make a circle permanent through repeated castings of the spell over the course of a year.

The Adventures Of Bonk And Crunk is an [[Orcish|Orc]] folk tale translated into [[Amoni]] 1872 [[IO]] by the scholar [[Vasia Anagna]], who heard it from a [[Kellish|Kell]] storyteller [[Olgierd Mizerak]].  It is not clear if [[Vasia Anagna]] ever existed at all, as new volumes continue to be published for thousands of years.  The story is understood to be rooted in [[Orcish|Orc]] oral tradition; a story to be told around the campfire especially for children.

!Volumes
The Adventures Of Bonk And Crunk is the longest running book series in history, spanning over 200 volumes across multiple centuries.  The series is considered a means of understanding culture of the times, as it has changed throughout the centuries in order to adapt to modern sensibilities.

!Ghostwriters
Each volume is assumed to be penned by a ghostwriter under the pseudonym [[Vasia Anagna]].  There are multiple writing styles, in which true fans argue over which are better, and which are considered cannon.

!The Characters
The gender of the two main characters is never clear, and the volumes often are contradictory.  It is common for Bonk to be close to death or survive unsurvivable circumstances.

{{quote{
''A Passage from Bonk And Crunk Chronicles of Love and War an Orcish retelling:
Translated from [[Black Speech]] to [[The Old Tongue]], to [[Amoni]] to [[The Common Tongue]]''

//Bonk looked loving into Crunk's eye and whispered.
“You can have the last slice. I mean it.” Crunk stared disbelievingly.
“You can’t just give that to anyone. That’s wasteful.” Crunk had enough of Bonk’s fullish behavior. Bonk lowered the axe and dismounted the steed.
“You can’t mean that.” Bonk’s eyes flickered with hurt. Crunk had taken the moment to fully take in the vibrant green of Bonk’s skin and brutal scar that raked across Bonk’s face.
“Who did that to you.” Crunk's voice betrayed Crunk showing a little more emotion than wanted. Bonk’s face went through many different emotions from one of hate to one of fear and disgust.
“Don’t worry about it, Crunk. You need to focus on the battle ahead.” Bonk grinned.
“Make sure not to get in my way. I will only think once before I hit you with my Spear.” Crunk’s eye held a serious glint.
“Ah, but then at least you’d be thinking of me.” Bonk looked at the last slice of meat on the table. Bonk reached for it only to have been beaten to it by Crunk.
“You said I can have this right?” Crunk laughed not really caring for Bonks answer.
“When it comes to you Crunk. You can always have the last slice.”
--
Crunk had already taken down 3,845.25 of the enemy, and yet froze in the middle of the battle, covered in blood. The pink charm pendent laid alone in the grass. No. It wasn’t alone, Bonk’s lifeless body lay there. Crunk started to run. When did this happen? How much blood was lost? Crunk dragged Bonk to a cave and started to carefully clean Bonk's wounds. Crunk couldn’t lose Bonk, Crunk hadn’t told Bonk the truth. Crunk loved Bonk and didn’t care if Bonk loved Crunk anymore. Crunk sat for hours waiting for any sign of movement. Suddenly, Bonk jumped up!
“Wow! That was a good nap!” Bonk sighed. “Wait. Where I? CRUNK!?” Bonk gave Crunk a death crushing hug. Anger swelled in Crunk’s heart.
“I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!” Crunk screamed.
“No, I was just pretending. I actually saw a pretty flower and went to smell it.” Bonk frowned. “Unfortunately, it put me to sleep. What a shame too, it looked like it tasted good.”
“You’re so stupid! Ugh!” Crunk went to leave. “But I think I love you.” Crunk decided that then was a good time to run away.
“Crunk?” Bonk gave a chase. Bonk caught up but tripped on top of Crunk. Crunk blushed.
“I think I love you too!” Bonk said.//

<pre>[&gt;img[images/items/airship/the-airship-triumph.jpg]]

The Airship Triumph was the first [[Airship]] made in 1021 [[AAP]].  It's maiden voyage was from it's parent city of [[Zylok]] to the city of [[Vedinium]] on the continent of [[Amon]].  [[Nester Arkwood]] enlisted the help of [[The Grey Companions]] when he was concerned of the threat of sabotage by [[The Elven Order]].  The sabotage occurred and was thwarted by [[The Grey Companions]], however the ship suffered heavy damage to the [[Arkstones]] crystals.  The damage caused the ship to speed up uncontrollably, much of the crew died before control was regained of the ship.  First Mate [[Klempton Reese]] assumed role of captain, with only [[The Grey Companions]], [[Enchanter|Enchantment]] [[Avix Ivumorn]], and the Sailors [[Destrian]], [[Merk]], and [[Pawlin]] surviving.

The ship had sped up past the full continent of [[Amon]], over the magical mist shrouded continent of [[Caldoria]] which at that time was submerged at the bottom of the ocean.  The ship was heavily damaged and sailing as a normal sailing vessel when it was attacked by [[The Guardian Of Caldoria]] before being sucked into a whirlpool - a giant maelstrom - that was created by the frequent breaches found in [[Caldoria's|Caldoria]] shield that guarded the city. 

!The Original Crew Of The Airship Triumph
* Captain [[Rotbert Del Sambra]]
* First Mate [[Klempton Reese]]
* [[Enchanter|Enchantment]] [[Avix Ivumorn]]
* Sailors [[Destrian]], [[Merk]], [[Henfrey]], [[Fulchard]], [[Fulk]], [[Geve]], [[Berengar]], [[Miel]], [[Reinhold]], and [[Pawlin]]

!Launch Of The Airship Triumph
The following speech was given by [[Eustacia Vaisanan]] and [[Nester Arkwood]] on the commencement and launch of the Airship Triumph:

{{quote{
[[Eustacia Vaisanan]] says &quot;We meet in front of [[The Athenaeum]] noted for knowledge, in a city noted for progress, in an [[Empire|The Viridian Empire]] noted for strength, and we stand in need of all three, for we meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and ignorance.

I am honored to introduce my dear friend and mentor, [[Nester Arkwood]].  He is the headmaster of [[The Athenaeum]], [[Zylokian|Zylok]] [[Arkanus First Class]], [[Distinguished Magus]] of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]], [[Lord Magister]] of [[The Magian Imperium]] - and the foremost expert of [[Enchantment]] in [[The Viridian Empire]].  [[Nester|Nester Arkwood]] is the inventor of the [[Arkstones]], and the lead designer of [[The Triumph Initiative]].  Please welcome, [[Nester Arkwood]]&quot;

[[Nester|Nester Arkwood]] begins, &quot;It is true, [[Eustacia|Eustacia Vaisanan]], that we are in need of strength, progress and knowledge.  However the greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds.  It is a striking fact that most of the [[Wizards|Wizardry]] that the world has ever known are alive and working today.  Despite that fact, the vast stretches of the unknown and the unanswered and the unfinished still far outstrip our collective comprehension.

Our ability to harness [[magic|Magic]] has increased Humanity's potential a thousand fold.  A single spell has the power to control nature to increase crop yields, cure many diseases and ailments, or do the work of a dozen men with a fraction of the effort.  So it is not surprising that some are content with our current progress.  Content to stay where we are and rest a little.  But this city of [[Zylok]], neigh the whole of [[The Viridian Empire]] was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them.  This [[Empire|The Viridian Empire]] was [[conquered|The Amoni Invasion]] by those who moved forward.

Yet with our understanding, Mankind is still within its infancy, with all of our knowledge we have yet to unlock the secrets of [[The First Age]].  An age of legends, filled with stories of our ancestors traveling the stars inside the bellies of eagles, or causing the whole world to weep for joy at a single performer.

This airship bears the name Triumph for it is one.  A Triumph of engineering and magery powered by enchantment.  [[Enchantment]] represents a new frontier of [[Wizardry]]... for it is with enchanted items that the power of magic becomes accessible to the general populace.  This ship is powered by an invention of mine that others have taken to call [[Arkstones]].  With them, this ship is capable of sustained flight across the [[Empire|The Viridian Empire]] at a speed that rivals horse and cart - and is expected to revolutionize trade and the economy.  Some of you may have arrived here through [[Teleportation]].  But [[Teleportation]] is costly, and impractical for commerce as it relies on the limited resources provided by a small handful of [[wizards|Wizardry]] trained in this advanced art.

I want to be the first to welcome you to a new age... and age of [[Enchantment]], where there are no limits to our possibilities.

The Airship Triumph will set sail for the city of [[Vedinium]] on the continent of [[Amon]].  An oversea journey that takes a traditional sailing vessel 18 days of travel.  The Triumph will complete the journey in only 3 days.  Docking towers like the one that stands behind me are built or under construction in nearly every major city that sits upon a shipping lane.  Before the year is out, Airship travel will revolutionize our society.

And therefore, as we set sail we ask for [[The Gods]] blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure in which man has ever embarked.  Thank You!&quot;

The Amoni Concord is the primary nation on the continent of [[Amon]].  Founded in 1479 [[IO]] after the fall of [[The Amoni Empire]], it is ruled by a loose federation of six leaders known as [[Tribunes|Tribune]].  Each [[Tribune]] governs a large geographical region of the continent known as a [[Polité]].

The Concord demands citizens pay a tithe, follow its laws, worship its gods, and bow to the installed local leadership (known as [[Lawmasters]]).  This accord has led to a prosperous century, primarily for the political elite known as [[Patriars|Patriar]].  Otherwise, most citizens of the Concord are left to their own devices.

A [[Tribune]] has ultimate authority over their lands and people.  These regions share in culture and free trade across [[Amon]], and consider themselves united in purpose despite being fragmented in rule.  This practice of governing is a vestige from [[Amon's|Amon]] troubled past, and the [[Amoni]] belief that no one person can be entrusted with the ultimate power of ruling [[Amon]].

[[The Whispers]] are regarded by most citizens of The Concord as ghost stories and urban legends often told to children as bogeymen to warn against disobeying parents or staying out too late.  Only the Concord's elite are aware that [[The Whispers]] truly exist.  They are magically trained assassins that answer directly to the [[Tribunes|Tribune]].</pre>

<div title="The Amoni Empire" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="201602071535" modified="202308011610" changecount="46">
<pre>The Amoni Empire was one of the oldest, largest and most powerful civilizations of [[Humans|Human]] of [[The Fourth Age]].  It was a fountain of science, art, and [[Magic]]; defined by military expansion and conquest.  The Empire eventually crumbled when, at its greatest territory extent, [[Nicomedian Trier]] (the last true [[Imperator]]) neglected to enforce his rule and the vast territory was divided into multiple successor [[Polités|Polité]] known as [[The Amoni Concord]].

The Empire existed for over 1,700 years, and at its height covered all of [[Amon]], and most of [[Ruje]] and [[Kellos]].  Due to it's vast extent and long endurance, the institutions and culture of [[Amon]] had a profound and lasting influence on these territories.  [[The Amoni Language|Amoni]] was a precursor to what modern day scholars refer to as [[The Common Tongue]].

!Conquest
The Amoni Empire comprised countless different conquered cultures, each assimilated into the totality of The Amoni Empire.  Though the military might of the Empire was fierce, their true strength was their ability to encourage conquered nations to accept their fair rule.  Their armies were well organized, and trained to conserve their energy during battle.  This allowed them to best armies much larger than their own.  Their government structure was built for scale, granting conquered nations a freedom and autonomy of their culture, as well as equal standing as a citizen whilst obeying the primary laws of the Empire.

!Origins
The Amoni Empire was formed in response to the evil intentions of [[Ammenon]] and [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]] in 3186 [[IO]], when it became clear that he sought immortality.  One of [[Ammenon's|Ammenon]] generals, [[Helio Gabreas]], succeeded from [[The Dynasty|The Vaecnan Dynasty]] to be named the first [[Imperator]] of The Amoni Empire.  There was a justifiable concern with placing ultimate power with another single individual, and [[The Amoni Assembly]] was established to keep the [[Imperator]] in check.  At this point in history, the Empire was but an ideal shared by a very small number of like minded individuals.  They met in secret for fear of discovery, and sought to undermine [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]] through sabotage, disinformation, and espionage executed within the [[Dynasty|The Vaecnan Dynasty]] itself.  For a decade, the resistance grew to phenomenal size, but remained unsuccessful in toppling the [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]].  For the next 1,000 years, The Amoni Empire clung to a fragile existence with a small amount of land on the northern tip of the continent of [[Amon]].  It survived through sheer will, aided by the fact that [[The Whispered One]] had his sights higher than territory or land.  It was eventually a spiritual and philosophical leader of the resistance named [[Poulcheria]] who struck the blow to bring the end of [[The Whispered One]].  After [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]] was destroyed, The Amoni Empire thrived and grew to be the dominant civilization on [[Asha]].

!Petronia's Laws
After the fall of [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]], the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity.  [[Petronia Adventa]] was named [[Imperator]] of the Empire, and she blessed the Empire with a system of laws known as [[Petronia's Laws]].  These laws, practices and guidelines set into motion a clear structure for governing; as well as rules by which future [[Imperators|Imperator]] and [[The Amoni Assembly]] would follow.  At the time, this ended the petty bickering and power struggles that were common in the early Empire.

!The Power Of The Assembly
Created to avoid placing ultimate power in the hands of a single individual, [[The Amoni Assembly's|The Amoni Assembly]] primary purpose was the provide checks and balances to the [[Imperator]].  While the power of [[The Amoni Assembly]] waxed and waned over the centuries, at its creation it also had the jurisdiction over criminal trials, regulation of festivals and religious cults, the granting of special honors, as well as the power to excuse an individual from legal liability.  It was [[The Amoni Assembly]] that created new legislation and who elected new [[Imperators|Imperator]] after their death, as well as had the power to enact a vote of no confidence in a sitting [[Imperator]].

!The Fall Of The Amoni Empire
[[The Fall Of The Amoni Empire]] did not occur as one swift action, but as a slow and painful death.  In 1846 [[IO]] [[Imperator]] [[Nicomedian Trier]] suffered a prolonged illness that resulted in his death.  His death is marked by historians as the start of [[The Fall Of The Amoni Empire]].  [[Kellos]] immediately seceded from the Empire, declaring [[Tarmon Gellius]] [[King]].  In 1664 [[IO]], [[Ruje]] secedes from the Empire in a bloody conflict known as [[The War Of Scales]].  1522 [[IO]] saw a schism within the religious order of [[The Canticle]], spinning off a new sect calling themselves [[The Divine Order]], lessening [[Amoni]] influence across [[Asha]].  Less than 50 years later, in 1479 [[IO]], The Amoni Empire formally disbands into a collection of successor territories naming itself [[The Amoni Concord]].

!Culture and People
While citizens of The Amoni Empire were comprised of peoples from many cultures and backgrounds, they all adopted portions of the culture of [[Amon]].  Men customarily preferred to keep their facial hair shaved, as a sign of sophistication and elite status; it was considered barbarous to have unkempt hair.  All citizens valued cleanliness, with public baths in all major cities and towns.  Gladiatorial combat was common in place of a death sentence for crimes.  In the arena, one could earn their freedom, or be forced into combat until your eventual (and guaranteed) demise.

<pre>The Amoni Invasion was the name of the military campaign [[Tarmon Gellius]] conducted when he sailed an army from [[Amon]] to [[Kellos]] in 1847 [[IO]].  History records the unprecedented victory of his advance, without a single defeat.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/kellos/the-green-sea/bandor/the-bandor-ampitheater.jpg]]
The Amphitheater is a central attraction to all who visit [[Bandor]].  It is host to various forms of public entertainment such as plays or musical performances.  Most often talked about is the gladiatorial combats that are fought here.  The combats are held on the 10th day of every month.  Many attend, and the gambling is as savage as the fighting.

The combats themselves are rarely to the death.  Combatants are allowed to yield at any moment, for the local militia would treat a death as murder.  Although death is uncommon, the battles are brutal and often bloody.  Contests may include gladiatorial contests, magical duels, battles against animals, or anything else the depraved violence hungry crowd can cook up.

Characters may enter the arena voluntarily, Gladiators can easily earn a sum of gold for winning a contest – more if the event is especially unfair, spectacular or well-sponsored.  Those contestants who yield make considerably less money.

Those who do break the few laws that exist in the city may find themselves as contestants in the next gladiatorial games.  Often these criminals have performed heinous crimes, and the arena battles are to the death.</pre>

It is rumored that the seven Ancients no longer experience the blood thirst but enjoy the refreshment and clarity it provides.  Their age though requires them to enter a dormant state that is so still that they can be mistaken for statues.</pre>

In the struggle however, the gate was damaged beyond repair.  Each of [[The Travelers]] as well as many other champions felt a surge of power that caused them to transcend their mortal limitations and become [[Apotheons|Apotheon]]; with divine powers akin to [[The Gods]].  With newfound strength and wisdom, [[The Travelers]] sought to bring harmony to [[Elysium]] by negotiating a peace between [[Arman Blackbane]] and his army who was assaulting the gates of [[Elysium]].</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/organizations/the-ashai.jpg]]
The Ashai are an ancient order of [[Druids|Druid]] that tend to the natural places of power on the continent of [[Amon]] and [[Ruje]].  They have existed since [[The Second Age]], but have been slowly decreasing in number.  The followers of The Ashai live an insular existence in remote areas, and only occasionally interacting with the outside world.  There are Shrines that can be found within some of the major cities of [[Amon]] and [[Ruje]] that are used to recruit new members to their dwindling ranks.

The Ashai are multi-racial and multi-cultural.  Accepting anyone into their ranks who has the spark to defend [[Asha]] from the forces inherent to [[The Fountains Of Creation]].  While primarily a [[Druidic|Druid]] order, there are individuals of all professions and persuasions who dedicate their lives to the cause.

!Guardians Of Places Of Power
The Ashai are the champions of the natural world, defending it from anything and anyone that threatens it.  They are the the children of the leaf, the wave, the stone, the storm, and the wild; and preserve [[the natural cycle|The Eternal Cycle]].  The Ashai are the gatekeepers, protecting [[Asha]] from forces outside of it who seek to enter in the natural places where the veil between worlds is weakest.

!Feins
The Ashai are structured into 6 groups called [[Feins|Fein]].  They are: [[The Leaf|The Fein Of The Leaf]], [[The Flame|The Fein Of The Flame]], [[The Wave|The Fein Of The Wave]], [[The Stone|The Fein Of The Stone]], [[The Storm|The Fein Of The Storm]], and [[The Wild|The Fein Of The Wild]].  Each [[Fein]] is led by an individual with the title of [[Herald]].

!Common Religious Practice
Major cities across [[Amon]] and [[Ruje]] often have within them a Shrine dedicated to the Ashai.  This Shrine acts as a means to recruit new followers to the order; however they are often overlooked and forgotten in place of more dominant religions such as [[The Canticle]].  As the Ashai revere [[The Mother|Valouria]], many favor worshiping her within the construct of [[The Canticle]].</pre>

<div title="The Astral Stream" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202209031653" modified="202212021554" tags="dimension" changecount="26">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/the-astral-stream/the-astral-stream.jpg]]
The Astral Stream is the boundary plane in which all of [[The Planes Of Existence]] lie within.  It is the connective tissue of the cosmos, a vast amount of nothingness; an amorphous realm where the will and the imagination have influence over the surrounding space.  Created by [[Umwe]], The Astral Stream is a source of [[Magic]]; the infinite manifestation of [[Umwe's|Umwe]] power.  [[The Divine Gate]] borders The Astral Stream, protecting it from the unknown horrors beyond in what is known as [[The Void]].

Though The Astral Stream is profoundly empty, it is so unthinkably vast that there exist matter littered throughout: island motes, and tumbling wreckage from divine battles.  What life does exist here survives by savaging these materials and preying on the helpless [[Souls|Soul]] who find themselves here accidentally.

!The Origin Of The Astral Stream
In the beginning, when [[Umwe]] first awakened, he created The Astral Stream as his domain.  It was here that [[Umwe]] lived, and grew.  After a time, he fashioned inside of The Astral Stream the [[Plane|The Planes Of Existence]] of [[Elysium]], with the purpose of creating his children there.  The Astral Stream is the collection of [[Umwe's|Umwe]] power.  Since his creation, he began storing collected power here; channeling it to perform miracles and feats of [[Magic]] for his own amusement.

!The Creation Of The Divine Gate
[[The Divine Gate]] was created at the end of [[The Second Age]], when [[Xander]] sacrificed himself for its creation.  In order to preserve all of the life which existed within [[The Planes Of Existence]], [[The Gods]] made the difficult decision to leave [[The Planes Of Existence]] behind; locking themselves and [[Azarad-Ji]] on the other side of [[The Divine Gate]].  Nothing can interact through the gate, not even [[The Gods]]; forever sealing the life inside in a bubble of protection.

!The Deep Astral
The furthest edges of The Astral Stream are referred to as [[The Deep Astral]].  Here, the pressure of the domain is the heaviest, and the area is rich with psychic storms and the home to [[Astral Dreadnought]].  Within [[The Deep Astral]], one can find [[The Divine Gate]].

!The Gith
The [[Gith]] were once [[Third Age|The Third Age]] [[Elves|Elf]], who used a [[Mythal]] to transport three of their cities into The Astral Stream.  Warped and transformed from their prolonged exposure to The Astral Stream, they are ruthless pillagers and raiders of many worlds.  They have lost many of their once [[Elven|Elf]] traits, and no longer feel the calling of [[The Fields Of Kalara]].

!Structure Of The Astral Stream
Any [[Magic]] that creates extra-dimensional space, such as a [[Haven Bag]], does so by channeling The Astral Stream.  As such, The Astral Stream is littered with individual pocket-dimensions, both temporary and permanent.  When a pocket dimension bursts for any reason, its contents spill out into The Astral Stream.

!Astral Projection
Those who do not find themselves physically in The Astral Stream are projecting themselves there outside of their body.  When this occurs, a long silver thread connects your Astral Self to your point of origin back to your body; if this thread is severed in any way, you die.</pre>

!The Athenaeum
The Athenaeum is the most renowned and foremost place of [[magical|Magic]] learning in [[Asha]].  It is located in the city of [[Zylok]] within [[The Viridian Empire]] on the continent of [[Kellos]].  It houses a library of magical tomes, a meeting and social place for members of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]], and a university for aspiring [[magicians|Magic]].  It was founded in 27 [[IO]] by [[Waywill]], [[Armondax]], [[Mysara]] and [[Fazar]].

!The University
People from around [[Asha]] come to The Athenaeum to learn skills of [[Magic]] from the finest teachers in the world.  The first day of introduction, the students are welcomed by the headmaster and matched to an advisor that follows them through the decade of study required to complete their training.  Students attend at age 14, and study for 10 years.  The first half of the 10 years is considered Lower School, and the last 5 years are upper school - both upper and lower school each have their own Deans.  

!Student Independent Project
The [[Student Independent Project]] or S.I.P. is a requirement for graduation, where 10th year students complete a capstone project that answers an essential question, develops their own magical research, or displays exceptional understanding of arcane studies.  Students are given the final two weeks to work solely on their project, in preparation for presenting their project to the faculty and students of all grades.  Completion of a success [[S.I.P.|Student Independent Project]] is required for graduation, students with missed deadlines, incomplete work, and lack of progress may forfeit senior privileges and may be enrolled in supervised study to help manage the assignments and deadlines.

!The Rules
There are rules that all students must obey without question.
* ''DO NO HARM:'' students are expected to respect the sanctity of life.  Any harm done intentionally to another member of [[The Athenaeum]] community is grounds for immediate expulsion.  Intentional property damage is also dealt with accordingly.
* ''DO NOT CHEAT:'' students are here to learn.  When they cheat, they cheat themselves out of a proper education, and they cheat their friends out of a fair competition.  This is grounds for immediate expulsion.
* ''RESPECT THE STAFF:'' all members of the faculty are to be treated with the utmost respect at all times.  Students should use the appropriate honorific when speaking to any of the staff (“[[Lord]]”, or “[[Lady]]” are appropriate - however they prefer “[[Professor]]”).  Students must always listen to and obey the instructions of a member of the faculty.
* ''RESPECT THE STUDENTS:'' fellow students have come to [[The Athenaeum]] for one reason: to learn.  Students are given every opportunity possible to realize this ambition.
* ''OTHER:'' there are many other lesser rules at [[The Athenaeum]] such as &quot;no running in the halls&quot; or &quot;stay quiet in class&quot; - many  of these are rooted in both common sense and common courtesy.  If for some reason, a students needs these explained, they will find [[Headmaster]] is only too happy to expound upon these details at length, while they scrub the school's front gate or clean out the stalls in [[The Menagerie]].

!Places Of Interest
* [[The Green]] is the central outdoor hub of The Atenaeum.  It is named after the green grass, topiaries, trees, and paths that connect the various buildings of campus.  The green is home to many of the clubs that students run, and is a central meeting place for students and faculty.  There are many benches and quiet nooks for students to congregate and study either in groups or individually.
* [[The Library Of The Athenaeum]] has magic texts exclusively stored for members of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].  The appointed librarians record access to materials that are deemed ‘questionable or dangerous’ (new acquisitions are first examined by the appointed [[Book-Warden]], who is the final judge).  It is said that the answer to every question is contained within these halls.  However, it is difficult to find materials pertaining to a certain subject and often requires both research and knowledge of the [[Elvish]] written language and a proficiency in magical research.
* [[The Cosmic Orrery]]  is a room within The Atenaeum at the top of [[The Tower Of Mysara]].  At the flick of a lever, a complex and delicate brass machine descends from the domed ceiling which can illuminate the room in patterns that resemble [[The Planes Of Existence]] using Illusory [[Magic]].
* [[The Athenaeum's Maker Space]] is a location stocked with materials that students can use in tinkering and crafting objects imbued with [[Magic]].
* [[Hawthorne Hall]] is the building that houses the faculty offices and bedroom suites.  Here faculty serve their office hours for student tutoring.  The [[Headmaster's Tower]] is connected to this building, complete with office, bedroom, and laboratory.
* [[The Mirror Of Resplendence]] is a hidden location deep under the school, built by the founders.  It contains a portal made from pure liquid [[Mana]] that connects as a gateway to other [[Planes Of Existence|The Planes Of Existence]].  It is guarded by a [[Beholder]] named [[Tyranthrax]]</pre>

<pre>&quot;The Ballad Of The Ferryman&quot; is a Sailor's tale that warns of a supernatural entity known only as [[The Ferryman]] who helps desperate sailor's in need of aid for a very steep price.

{{quote{
There once was a boy, born youngest of seven;
he left his home at the young age of eleven.
He was born of the land, but his heart longed for the sea;
so when a ship sailed in, he joined it with glee.
[[The Blood Moon]] it was named, sporting a pirate flag;
the captain was gruff, the crew was ragtag.
The captain eyed the boy with a cautious glare;
offering him a place on his ship, along with a share.
The boy soon discovered once aboard the ship;
his only share waiting was the end of a whip.
For this captain he joined was both cruel and unkind;
and in the hold of [[The Blood Moon]] he was confined.

The young cabin boy learned to keep his head down;
he swore that one day he'd turn the ship into the crown.
For while the crew pillaged and they killed and they fought;
it was only his freedom which the cabin boy sought.
The captain, amused by his machinations so bold;
said he'd release him for the sum of ninety-nine gold.
From then on, after every scrap and every raid;
the cabin boy put his hands out, asking for aid.
The captain laughed and he spit, but the crew gave into pity;
so he could one day buy his way back to the city.
The cabin boy, grateful for the crew's charitable boon;
promised to bring great luck to [[The Blood Moon]].

And then after years of enduring endless abuse;
the boy amassed enough gold to be set loose.
He approached the captain and presented ninety-nine;
to which the captain responded: 'This gold is now mine'.
'Find another ninety-nine, if you wish to be free';
'Until then, your only hope is the sea'.
The cabin boy, unwilling to spend years here again;
walked the length of the plank to face his own end.
He uttered a warning to the captain and crew;
'I will return for my gold, and my just due'.
And with a cry and a splash almost too faint to hear;
The crew watched him die and they shed a tear.

Years passed, and the captain forgot about that night;
until his quartermaster knocked on his door in a fright.
'Captain, there's a boy on the deck asking for pay';
'We're not sure how he got on, but should we send him away?'.
The captain disturbed, sought to quell this unrest;
but instead what he saw took the air from his chest.
For it was the dead cabin boy, to settle the score;
with his hands out for gold as he had done so before.
The crew of [[The Blood Moon]] gave the boy space;
their fear and their dread clear on their face.
They dropped to their knees offering prayer, coin, and gem;
but he was singly focused on the captain, not them.

'The sea was my hope, just as you had once said';
'and now I've returned, to come take your head'.
'But I will have mercy, just as the sea did for me';
'Bring me my gold and I will leave you be'.
The captain was bold, and thought himself more clever;
and sealed his fate with a resounding 'Never!'.
The boy said 'Indeed', his voice sad with remorse;
'You will only bring death if you follow this course'.
Then as the captain struck out with his knife;
the cabin boy stole the remains of his life.
The boy remembered the prior compassion of the crew,
'Thank you for your kindness', and dove back in the blue.

Of all of the tall tales, [[The Ferryman]] they say;
is the tale which carries the heaviest sway.
The tale of a cabin boy with a life so dour;
and plunged into the deep and came out with power.
So if your ship be adrift, sundered by storm, or lost;
[[The Ferryman]] can be called if you can afford the cost.
Three drops of blood, two coins and a [[Soul]] willingly given;
and to safe harbor your ship will be purposefully driven.
He is always listening to the pleas of the helpless and weak;
but only assists in situation most bleak.
If you have no sea legs, still heed my advice;
For [[The Ferryman]] help all, for the same price.

<pre>The Black Night was a series of coordinated terrorist attacks carried out by [[The Remnant]] on behalf of [[The Whispered One]] on the 3rd of [[Eleasis]] in 1025 [[AAP]]. The attackers were organized into three groups.  In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, there was distrust and fear across both [[Amon]] and [[The Viridian Empire]].

!The Assault On The Athenaeum
//''Goal:'' To Gain Possession Of [[The Shard Of Sakkrad]]//
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-isles/zylok/the-athenaeum/penelope-kensington/penelope-kensington-portrait.jpg][Penelope Kensington]] &lt;br&gt;[[Penelope Kensington]] | [img[images/characters/ammenon/harmost-xawn-portrait.jpg][Harmost Xawn]] &lt;br&gt;[[Harmost Xawn]] |
The first group attacked [[The Athenaeum]].  Led by [[Penelope Kensington]] and [[Harmost Xawn]], a group of 10 [[Remnant Soldiers|The Remnant]] stormed the most formidable institute of [[Magical Learning|Magic]] in order to steal [[The Shard Of Sakkrad]].  [[Penelope Kensington]] used her status as a [[Professor]] and her friendship with [[Nester Arkwood]] to manipulate the students and staff.  The faculty valiantly defended the students, and were able to defeat many of [[The Remnant]] attackers, but not before [[Penelope|Penelope Kensington]] and [[Xawn|Harmost Xawn]] escaped through teleportation with [[The Shard|The Shard Of Sakkrad]].
38 individuals died in the attack on [[The Athenaeum]], including [[Headmaster]] [[Nester Arkwood]], [[Professor]] [[Thog Stoneheart]], and [[Professor]] [[Avix Ivumorn]].

!Deepwater Attack
//''Goal:'' To Gain Possession Of The Eye Of A Sphinx//

The second group attacked the capital of [[The Viridian Empire]], the city of [[Deepwater]].  [[Lionel Keelen]], [[Lord Commander]] of [[The Knights Of Deepwater]], blinded by his hatred for the [[Orcish Race|Orc]], was turned by [[The Remnant]].  He would stop at nothing to see a new world order and prevent [[Emperor]] [[Jacob Jedaleon III]] from allowing the [[Orcs|Orc]] to unite with [[The Viridian Empire]] under a common banner.  Under the darkness of night, [[Lionel Keelen]] murdered the [[Emperor]] while [[Gorgothuun]], the [[Dracolich]] ravaged the city and attacked [[The Temple Of The Divine]].  [[Gorgothuun]] killed the [[Sphinx]] [[Anku Isetarri Kemat]], taking her eyes for the resurrection of [[The Whispered One]].

!Pillaging The Stormvault Of Amon
//''Goal:'' To Gain Possession Of The Shield Of The Hidden Lord//
| [img[images/characters/amon/gold/romadra-khar-portrait.jpg][Romadra Khar]] &lt;br&gt;[[Romadra Khar]] |
The third group attacked [[The Stormvault]] in [[The Vulcanfell Highlands]] of [[Amon]], led by the [[Tiefling]] [[Vampire]] [[Romadra Khar]]. Along with a group of over a dozen members of [[The Remnant]], [[Romadra|Romadra Khar]] broke into one of the most secure locations in [[Amon]] and left with [[The Shield Of The Hidden Lord]].  [[Romadra|Romadra Khar]] was captured during the heist, and was locked away as a prisoner within [[The Stormvault]].  [[The Shield|The Shield Of The Hidden Lord]] was taken to the city of [[Palma Flora]] to later be united with [[The Whispered One]].

!Speech Of Artimas Meliger
{{quote{
“Today, our school and very way of life came under attack in a series of deadly and deliberate terrorist acts.  The victims were innocent students and teachers, sons and daughters, friends.  Their lives ended abruptly in acts of evil, acts of despicable terror.  
[[Headmaster]] [[Nester Arkwood]], my dear friend and mentor is confirmed dead.  Along with [[Professor]] [[Avix Ivumorn]], [[Professor]] [[Thog Stoneheart]] and 35 of our fellow students.

We know now that in conjunction with the attack on [[The Athenaeum]], a second attack was made in our [[Empire's|The Viridian Empire]] capital of [[Deepwater]].  [[Emperor]] [[Jacob Jedaleon III]] is dead, and the city remains held under siege by a [[skeletal dragon|Gorgothuun]].
The search for those responsible is underway, but it is clear that the attackers were aided by one of our own: [[Professor]] [[Penelope Kensington]].  There are similar reports of people in power aiding in the [[Emperor's|Jacob Jedaleon III]] assassination.  We will see justice done, and will make no distinction between those that committed these acts and those that aided or harbored them.
I ask for your prayers for all those that grieve.  For all of the children whose lives have been shattered.  For all those who’s feelings of safety and security has been taken from them.
It is grave news, but I hereby announce [[The Athenaeum]] is closed indefinitely; until we can once again ensure the safety of this institution.  While we may be knocked down, we are not defeated.  It is with sorrow that I send you home, and pray we all return next semester.&quot;

The Bloodletter quill is a [[magical|Magic]] artifact used by [[Wizards|Wizardry]] to transcribe special effects into their [[Spell Book]].  Powered by the caster's own blood, the quill resembles a creature of blood red skin with thorny appendages cascading down the quill.  The quill is carved from [[Bloodwood]], an exotic wood of red hue.  A singular glass eye is affixed to the hilt of the quill.

The origins of the quill are unknown, but are dated back to [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]] of [[The Third Age]].  Crafted in a time when [[Humans|Human]] were dabbling in the dark arts of [[Wizardry]] and [[Blood Magic]].

It was last in the possession of [[Alana Underwood]], who was too nervous to use it.

|//Wondrous item, Very Rare//|
|&lt;hr/&gt;|
|You can modify a spell in your [[Wizard|Wizardry]] [[Spell Book]] using this special pen, using your own blood.  You re-write the spell on your [[Spell Book]] with this quill using your blood instead of ink.  You can select one metamagic option listed below.  You lose the number of Hit Dice notes for each option applied to modify the spell.  For instance, if you use the quill to transcribe the //Extended Spell// feature onto a spell you lose 1 Hit Dice.  Furthermore, the losing of the hit dice reduces the maximum number of hit dice available to the character.  While the character can utilize the quill as often as they want, they cannot lose all of their hit dice.  To undo the effect of the Quill, it is sufficient to rip off the pages written in blood and destroy them.|
|__Metamagic options:__|
|* ''Distant Spell:'' (1 Hit Dice) The spell's range is doubled, or 30 feet - whichever is more.|
|* ''Empowered Spell:'' (1 Hit Dice per re-roll) You may re-roll 1 damage dice, but must use the re-roll.|
|* ''Extended Spell:'' (1 Hit Dice) For spells 1 minute or longer, you double the duration to a maximum of 24 hours.|
|* ''Heightened Spell:'' (1 Hit Dice) You cause disadvantage on any required saving throw|
|* ''Quickened Spell:'' (1 Hit Dice) A spell that takes 1 action can be cast in 1 bonus action.  Otherwise casting time is cut in half.|
|* ''Subtle Spell:'' (1 Hit Dice) You can cast the spell using only your [[Arcane Focus]] and no verbal or somatic components.|
|* ''Twinned Spell:'' (1 Hit Dice per spell level) When you cast a spell that targets a single creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can target a second creature in range.|</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/baator/avernus/the-bone-brambles.jpg]]
The Bone Brambles are a corrupted forest in [[Avernus]] within the plane of [[Baator]].  It was originally a grove within [[The Feywild]] until it was corrupted and brought to [[Avernus]] by a [[Hag Coven]] known as [[The Coven Of The Bramble Root]] comprised of [[Red Ruth]], [[Old Ethel]], and [[Mad Maggie]].  After the [[Coven|Hag Coven]] disbanded, The Bone Bramble has become the home of [[Red Ruth]].

The Bone Brambles are made of thick white vines with nasty thorns.  It has grown into a maze-like structure with narrow corridors and arched ceilings made of brambles.  Skeletons of unwary travelers can be seen within the moving vines.  The walls move, making it treacherous to traverse.  The brambles feed on blood and flesh, and the spirits of the brambles are trapped and forced to haunt those who enter.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/the-orcish-lands/the-boneyard.jpg]]
The Boneyard is a dead magic zone located within [[The Orcish Lands]] just east of [[Shadow Holde]] and [[The Southspine Peaks]].  It tends to collect animals with a connection to [[Mana]] as a place to come and die.  They journey here, at the end of their life, letting their life force be pulled from them within the [[Mana Dead Zone]].

[[Familiars|Familiar]] will not cross the threshold into this place, and it is not safe to stay in The Boneyard for long.  [[Wizards|Wizardry]] will find their use of [[Magic]] greatly diminished, and [[Sorcerers|Sorcery]] will feel nauseous and weakened.  [[Wizards|Wizardry]] with spell slots will lose 1 spell slot every 4 hours (starting with the lowest level slot) they remain here.  [[Sorcerers|Sorcery]] or creatures with innate magic lose a spell slot every hour.  These loses are permanent until a long rest is had outside of The Boneyard.

For miles around The Boneyard there is no life.  No trees, no grass, no birds or insects.  It is as if the lifeforce has been sucked dry from all living things.  Any vegetation that survives on the fringe is grey and withered.  This creates a field of desolation that is punctuated by pillars of natural stone that protrude from the grey ground like giant clawed fingers.

The ground is littered with the crushed bones of creatures that have died here, many bones brittle and unrecognizable due to age.  These crushed bones are ubiquitous and it is nearly impossible to travel The Boneyard without your feet crunching on bones.

!The Wickers
Floating around the area are small motes of concentrated magical energy that feed on other sources of [[Magic]] known as [[Wickers|Wicker]].  These motes always travel in a straight line towards the center of The Boneyard known as [[The Sink]], moving through creatures and objects to do so.  They are not intelligent and do not react to living creatures.

!Dead Magic Zone
There are many theories as to what causes the Boneyard's [[Mana Dead Zone]].  Perhaps there is something buried beneath the ground - some creature or device that is hampering the ability for [[Mana]] to coalesce.  Perhaps it is on a [[Ley Line]] network that is absorbing [[Mana]] into another [[Dimension]] or [[Plane Of Existence|The Planes Of Existence]].  Either way, any connection with [[Mana]] is either lost or significantly reduced while inside The Boneyard.

!Mother Trudy
Living within the sun bleached ribcage of a [[Dragon]] is [[Mother Trudy]], a [[Hag]] who makes her living feeding off of the unlucky travelers who come her way.  She is fond of appearing in the guise of a woman in her mid 30's with long curly black hair and finely made clothing named [[Maren Trostentier]].</pre>

The Steelbreakers, better known as The Brotherhood, are a [[Dwarven|Duergar'Ran]] crime family affiliated with [[The Council Of Thieves]] in the city of [[Tszanthus]] in the continent of [[Ruje]].  This family is noted for being both ruthless and dangerous, living by the creed that &quot;family is all&quot; and believing in &quot;blood for blood&quot;.  The Brotherhood began as a collection of [[Dwarven|Duergar'Ran]] blacksmiths who banded together to protect their businesses from the criminal gangs found in the city of [[Tszanthus]].  Over time, they fell into criminal activities themselves and now are controlled by the The Steelbreaker family; who used force to assume their dominant position.

The Brotherhood specializes in weapons dealing, shop extortion, and prostitution and use their connections to extort both clients and workers.  While The Brotherhood recruits from the dregs of [[The Lower Streap]], only members of The Steelbreaker family or [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] can advance into leadership positions.

!Position Within The Council Of Thieves
While they hold a position within [[The Council Of Thieves]], it is a precarious one earned with violence and blood.  The other members of [[The Council|The Council Of Thieves]] find the practices of [[The Brotherhood]] barbaric, as The Steelbreakers are now known for their subtlety.  The Brotherhood rules [[The Lower Streap]] with an iron fist, and seeks to gain even higher favor within [[The Council Of Thieves]], and will do anything to achieve it.

!Affiliated Gags
[[The Siphoners]] and [[The Little Lambs]] operate independently in [[The Lower Streap]] and swear their fealty to The Brotherhood.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/children-of-the-forge.jpg]]

The Children Of The Forge (or &quot;The Forged&quot;) were living beings who augmented their body with metal and [[Magic]].  They are powered by a [[Dragonshard]] made using [[Blood Magic]] and a plant known as [[Bluegloss]], which stains their organic parts pale blue.  The Children Of The Forge originate from [[Caldoria]], and are created by an ancient ritual from [[The Second Age]] performed by the [[Dragonborn]].  They are secretive with their process, and are selective in who they choose to join their ranks.  Currently, only [[Dragonborn]] pure-blood are permitted to take on the mantle of the forge.

Their power and prestige has waned over the generations.  It has become more difficult to find younglings willing to undergo the rituals to meld themselves to [[Magic]] and metal.  [[The House Of The Eternal]], their mighty stronghold in [[Caldoria]] is not much more than a grey stone ruin - not being repaired or extended in ages.  Even diminished, The Children Of The Forge command the respect of the [[Dragonborn]] of [[Caldoria]].

!Beyond Living
The Children Of The Forge are constructs.  They can experience anger, pain, fear and hatred like their original forms.  However they no longer require food, drink, sleep, or breath.  They do not sleep and instead enter a form of hibernation where they are completely inactive but fully aware of their surroundings.  For the uninitiated, a hibernating Child Of The Forge may be mistaken for a statue.

!Transference
The Forged were born living beings.  They wished to extend their lives to seek immortality, and were willing to use [[Blood Magic]] to achieve it.  For a living being to become a Child of The Forge, they must take part in multiple [[Transference Rituals|The Transference Ritual]] in which they unnaturally augment their bodies with metal and [[Magic]].  As the ritual is taking place, the being's consciousness is also changed - and with each ritual becomes more callous and disconnected from the living.  Those who don't prescribe to the beliefs of The Children Of The Forge suggest their very [[Soul]] has been stripped away or altered, revealing a new entity entirely.  There are many risks with the ritual, in which the host may die or become a mindless version of themselves.

The ritual requires the magical essence of a flower native to [[Caldoria]] known as [[Bluegloss]].  In all forms it is lethal if consumed by the living, but can be magically distilled to form a crystalline structure that acts as a power source for The Child Of The Forge.  These crystals, known as [[Dragonshards|Dragonshard]] are difficult to manufacture using a secretive technique.  The [[Dragonshard]] is created through [[Blood Magic]] and [[Sorcery]], and can be very volatile until placed under the skin of the host.

!Upkeep
Even the eldest of The Children Of The Forge, who have gone through thousands of [[Transference Rituals]] retain portions of their original organic body.  This body responds to natural healing and healing [[Magic]], however their metalic parts require upkeep.

The [[Dragonshards|Dragonshard]] that power The Children Of The Forge last anywhere from 3-5 years, though some accounts vary.  The [[Dragonshard]] must be replaced or the creature will die; this creates a dependency on a supply of [[Bluegloss]] to extend their life.  As this [[Dragonshard]] is needed to power their form, they can only survive for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 30 seconds).  When this time has elapsed, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until the power source is replaced.

!Modification
The Children Of The Forge revel in modifying and improving their form.  This is similar to an addiction, and there are those who have modified their body beyond recognition.  They have added wings, multiple limbs, weapons, and armor.  After multiple modifications, The Children Of The Forge lose their connection to their former self and see no limit to their potential.

The Chrono Ocullum is an enchanted artifact made by [[Erik Doorhaus]] in 1023 [[AAP]].  It is a brass amulet with arcane symbols around the edge and a deep purple refined [[Residuum]] crystal that glows bright blue when activated.

When created, the Chrono Ocullum became unstable and warped [[The Eternal Cycle]] itself, launching [[Erik Doorhaus]], [[Minerva Carrington]], and [[Desini Orosco]] into a time loop.  In doing so, they created a time paradox in which they assisted [[Nester Arkwood]] in re-discovering [[Enchantment]], launching the career of [[Sanders]], and inadvertently creating [[The Emerald Order]].

{{quote{
//In the embrace of The Liminal's many faces, we find our own reflection.//
''-[[The Book Of Atl]]''
}}}

The Church Of The Final Atonement, often colloquially refered to as &quot;The Church Of 10,000 Gods&quot; is the predominant religion of [[The Hegemony]] of [[Ruje]].  The faith holds a profound and unique belief system centered around a mysterious entity known as [[The Liminal]] that inhabits the deep jungles of the mainland of [[Ruje]].  At the core of the church's tenets is the concept of final atonement and ascension, ultimately leading to the culmination of the universe.

!Doctrine And Beliefs
The church's primary tenet revolves around the belief that the diverse [[Gods|The Gods]] worshiped by other religions are but facets of a singular divine entity known as [[The Liminal]].  In the eyes of the faithful, [[The Liminal]] is the supreme being, a transcendent deity, and the source of all creation.  This unified perspective on divinity differentiates them from the followers of other faiths who may venerate various [[Gods|The Gods]] as discrete entities.

A central belief of The Church Of The Final Atonement is the notion of life as a spiritual test.  This life is considered a crucible where each individual must face trials and tribulations that challenge their moral fiber, compassion, and resilience.  Those who pass these tests are said to ascend to higher levels of existence, moving closer to divinity.

Doctrine is written within a holy scripture known as [[The Book Of Atl]], (Atl=Water/Home Of Our Ancestors).  [[The Iron Law]] contains quotes from this scripture.  The practitioners of the faith organize themselves around the titles of [[Templar]] and [[Warlock]].  [[The Book Of Atl]] has core tenets around how to think and behave, but has been twisted over the centuries by The Church, allowing for corruption.

!The God Of Many Faces
[[The Liminal]] is also referred to as &quot;The God Of Many Faces&quot;, and is seen as a complex and multi faceted deity.  It possesses a duality of both benevolent and malevolent aspects.  The faithful believe [[The Liminal]] has the power to restore the splendor of [[The First Age]], and send a pilgrimage to seek it out every 77 years.  Each pilgrimage only one of the pilgrims is granted a wish or boon, and the others are never heard from again.</pre>

The council provides guidance for all [[Elves|Elf]], regardless of their specific faction or clan.  The council is tasked with making decisions such as alliances with other [[Races]], trade agreements, and a means to pool resources in times of great need.  The council is a unifying force for the [[Elves|Elf]]; helping to bridge any internal divisions or conflicts that may arise.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/the-feywild/the-court-of-stars/the-court-of-stars.jpg]]
The Court Of Stars is the most sacred and ancient location within [[The Feywild]] where all [[Archfey]] come to convene and merge their royal courts to make decisions and discuss matters that affect the entirety of [[The Feywild]].  Although there is no [[Archfey]] who rules these lands, [[Lady Kalamatri]], [[Queen]] of [[The Summer Court]], has traditionally been the one to convene these meetings, lending a degree of order to the otherwise tumultuous proceedings.

!History and Origins
The Court Of Stars is the birthplace and center of [[The Feywild]], the sacred ground where all [[Archfey]] first awoke before going on to form their own realms in their image.  This ancient kingdom was originally the domain of the [[Archfey]] [[SenaCethu]], whose name has long since been forgotten, erased from memory by powerful [[Magic]].  [[SenaCethu]] was once the ruler who oversaw all of [[The Feywild]], a figure of immense power and authority, until his banishment for reasons lost to memory.  Now, The Court Of Stars stands as a monument to the beginning of [[The Feywild]], a place of reverence where the [[Archfey]] gather to honor their origins and shape the future of their world.

!The Great Congress
When the powerful [[Archfey]] gather for a parliament, they merge their royal courts into one great congress.  The court is filled with intrigue, where the large entourage of attendants vie and scheme for position among the various factions.  Despite this chaotic dance of power, allegiances, ambition, and treachery - there has never been open conflict within The Court Of Stars.  Any onlooker would see a civil discourse between powerful immortal entities.

!Notable Locations
* [[The Palace Of Eternity]] - is the first and most iconic structure within The Court Of Stars.  It is a breathtaking edifice that stands at the very center of the realm, once the home of [[SenaCethu]], but now vacant but for the times in which the [[Archfey]] convene for court.  The palace is not merely a building, but a living entity, attuned to the whims of the [[Archfey]] who enter its halls.
* [[The Starbound Glade]] - is an open, mystical clearing where the sky offers a window into the other [[Planes Of Existence|The Planes Of Existence]].  The glade is known for its tranquil beauty, and a place for reflection, meditation, or powerful rituals.

They are guardians of ancient knowledge and lore, and obsessively monitor foreign mages on the continent and govern errant magic use.  They gain their name from the black robes with silver lining that they wear.  Members also have a magical tatoo on their forehead, of three tall rectangles (representing a tower).

!Worshipers Of The Weave
They worship [[Mana]] as a [[God|The Gods]], seeking its power and wisdom.  They believe it is a living organism to be manipulated and tamed, or reasoned with.  The Cowled Wizards seek out those who have been driven insane through failed spellcasting; as some babble incoherently claimed to have been &quot;touched by the goddess&quot;, seeing two intense pale blue eyes within their mind.  Despite this, The Cowled Wizards do not employ idols to their deity; they seek only to understand.

!History
The organization is new, compared to the ancient [[Uskard]] traditions of [[The Way]].  The Cowled Wizards were formed in 452 [[IO]] by [[Tarriq Al-Mattar]], some 400 years before [[The Destruction Of Uskard]].  In the modern day, they see themselves as saviors of the art of [[Magic]].

The Delver's Well is a feasthall in [[The Lower Streap]] of the city of [[Tszanthus]] on the continent of [[Ruje]].  It is owned by a [[Tiefling]] named [[Wright]] and many people from across the city flock here for food, drink and entertainment.  It is made famous by the large pit in the center of the establishment that descends into [[The Undercity Of Tszanthus]].

!Entrance To The Undercity
The Delver's Well boasts the only publicly available entry into [[The Undercity Of Tszanthus]], making it an attraction for many across the city and all walks of life and sations, eager to see another set of adventurers (or &quot;delvers&quot;) make their way underneath.  [[Wright]] forces any would-be delvers to pay a fee down and back (up front) as well as signing a waiver attesting that she is not liable for any injuries, losses or death suffered while exploring.

The opening is a 50ft wide round shaft that historians believe was once the home of the Mad [[Oeridian]] [[Sorcerer|Sorcerer]] [[Drakon Nhauxzor]], famous for the vile experiments and twisted labyrinthine lair.  Few dare to explore the trap filled dungeon, and those that do never return.  There do exist those that for a thrill descend to explore the first few rooms that have been plundered; but quickly retreat back to the safety of The Delver's Well content with the story of their return.

Entering the well is difficult, as the 75ft drop into complete darkness is completed using a rickety wooden contraption that lowers would-be explorers by rope.  When returning, delvers are asked to bang on a brass gong that is placed at the base of the tower to announce their desire to be lifted to the surface.

<pre>The Demon Plague was a pandemic of [[Magical|Magic]] origin in the region of [[Kellos]] during 24 [[IO]].  History tells us that a group of cultists called [[The Holy Scourge]] who worshiped the might of [[Azarad-Ji]] were attempting to bring about a new [[Desecration]].  It is believed now that their goal had been to wipe out the weak element of the [[Human]] race, so that only the followers of [[Azarad-Ji]] would remain.  They wanted to prove their loyalty and earn his favor.  Many believed that they themselves had hoped to break open [[Azarad-Ji's|Azarad-Ji]] prison, and become immortal [[Kiraga]] and build an empire for their master where the others had failed.
	
[[The Holy Scourge]], led by [[Teldinath Dagon]] used their magic to draw into this world a curse woven by the [[Dathairä]] that when unleashed drew out the darkest parts of the [[Mortal Soul|Soul]].  The Demon Plague spread like wild fire, leaving madness and war in its wake.  Those it effected began to change, developing powers and vileness not unlike the [[Dathairä]] known as [[Soulfiends]].  They fought amongst themselves.  The taste of blood being the only thing to satisfy them.  It is believed that the plague enveloped [[The Holy Scourge]] as well.

It was not until four powerful wizards joined forces: [[Armondax]], [[Mysara]], [[Waywill]] and [[Fazar]].  Together, they beat back the plague and brought humanity back from the brink of destruction.  It was this act, that caused them to form what is now known as [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].</pre>

<pre>The [[Uskardeen]] were people living on the continent of [[Uskard]] spanning a thriving civilization.  Their culture was heavily reliant on [[Blood Magic]], and suffered great loss due to an undocumented magical event which caused their government to crumble in 29 [[IO]], known to locals as &quot;[[The Mourning]]&quot;.

A young [[Uskardeen]] princess known as [[Vesna Zeuxis]] was blessed with the gift of [[Foretelling]].  She saw in a vision the destruction of her homeland, and tried to warn her people.  Many believed her vision, but not her paranoid father.  Against her father's order, [[Vesna Zeuxis]] and her followers began preparing for a journey to flee across the sea.  He sent an army to stop his daughter and her followers from leaving.  As the army approached, dark red clouds formed in the sky - and the princess knew the destruction had begun.  Fire rained from the sky, destroying the fleet of ships and the approaching army.  Refugees clung to rafts and makeshift vessels and traveled the great distance to [[Kellos]], where they assimilated into the culture.

Their magical influences tainted the culture of the people of [[Kellos]], who were being ravaged by [[The Demon Plague]].  The [[Uskardeen]] were shunned and only found solace in the barren desert now known as [[The Waste]].  Both [[The Demon Plague]] and the refugees from [[Uskard]] caused [[Cyril Viridian]] to begin his war on magic known as the [[Azutan Nagyos]].</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/organizations/the-divine-order-symbol.jpg]]
The Divine Order is a religious institution within [[The Viridian Empire]] that furthers the ideals and tenants of [[The Gods]].  It is highly organized, and ubiquitous across the realm, with churches and places of worship in every town and village of [[The Empire|The Viridian Empire]].  This makes The Divine Order one of the single most influential groups in all of [[The Viridian Empire]].  It is an important social institution, teaching temperance and patience in all things.

!The Great Schism
The Divine Order was formed in 1522 [[IO]], predating [[The Viridian Empire]] by more than 1,500 years.  Breaking from the teachings of [[The Canticle]] in [[Amon]], The Divine Order broke from tradition in not considering [[Valouria]] as one of [[The Gods]] of worship.  This religious schism further fractured the ties between [[Kellos]] and [[Amon]].

!Worship
No god is worshiped singly or more than another, [[The Gods]] [[Umwe]], [[Qualok]], [[Lucian]], [[Kombar]], and [[Xander]] are all worshiped equally and together.  [[The Birth Of Light And Truth]] is an ancient tome written by [[Innocentius Lucaenus]], who is considered to be the founder of the philosophy of The Divine Order.

!The Clergy
[[Priests|Priest]] of [[The Divine Order]] are expected to live respectful of life, live honestly, and never be untruthful.  They are known to travel great distances to teach these doctrines to others.  Greed, cruelty, laziness, and jealousy are shunned.  It should be noted that The Divine Order has a strong presence in [[The Viridian Empire]], and a wandering member may find aid in one of the many churches or temples throughout the land.  The Order claims all of its members as children, and gives them personal aid whenever it is possible.  The church may assist with room and board, living expenses, necessary travel supplies, or support in times of a crisis.  Every member has a commitment to support their members in times of need.</pre>

These worshipers are not loved, but feared proselytizing the rightful fear and respect of [[Umberlee]], for her wrath is the fury of the waves that swallow ships, shatter seawalls, and rise to race far inland to flood and drown.

[[Umberlee]] cares not why people worship her, only that they do.  Each member of The Drowned was personally touched by [[Umberlee]]; surviving a drowning event.  Many speak of seeing [[Umberlee]] under the water, and waking upon the shore with a pearl inside of their mouth.  These individuals, sometimes called Umberlants, are not loved; they are feared.

Other than The Drowned having been saved by [[Umberlee]], she rarely comes to interact or favor individual mortal. They make no temples or shrines, and are often forever touched by their drowning.  Some become prophets, barking out prophecies at any passerby on street corners; others quietly go about their lives only to one day be called on by [[Umberlee]] to repay their debt.  </pre>

The Dusk Court is a mysterious and ethereal realm within [[The Feywild]], a domain where twilight reigns supreme, and the boundary between dreams and reality is thin.  There is a haunting beauty here, where the flora and fauna have adapted to the environment.  Luminescent plants glow softly under a sky of dappled colors, and the fauna have adapted to the shadows.

!A Sanctuary For Those Who Seek Comfort
The Dusk Court is a sanctuary for those who seek the comfort in the twilight, a place where the night is not something to be feared, but rather embraced and understood.  Here, things can find themselves more easily concealed and transformed.

!Geography
The geography of The Dusk Court is diverse, encompassing dense forests, mist-covered valleys, and shimmering lakes that reflect the twilight sky like mirrors.  The forests are ancient and vast, with towering trees whose leaves glow in the dim light.  The lands team with life, from the soft rustling of nocturnal creatures to the distant calls of mystical beings that only appear at dusk.

It is generally believed that the group was founded millennia ago by a renegade group of [[Yuan-Ti]] intellectuals who sought to escape the rigid dogma and structure of [[Yuan-Ti]] society.

What fragments are left of [[Valouria's|Valouria]] mind are at the core of [[The Shadowfell]].  It is restless, having fits of semi-consciousness, a shadow of its former self; unable to remember who it is or why it exists.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/amon/the-elden-reaches.jpg]]
The Elden Reachers is a region inside of [[The Polité Of Copper]] on the continent of [[Amon]], located on an island chain and peninsula on the western coast of the continent.  It is well known as the birthplace of [[The Amoni Empire]] after the fall of [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]], and the region has a rich history and distinctive cultural identity.

!Geography
The area boasts a rugged coastline adorned with towering cliffs, picturesque mountains, and rocky islands.  The Elden Reaches are renowned for its breathtaking waterfalls and is home to the native [[Elephant Koi]], large and colorful fish that add to the unique charm of the area.

!History
The Elden Reaches played a crucial role in the downfall of [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]].  The peninsula was considered strategically and economically unimportant, and became a refuge for those few living souls who survived the scourge of [[Ammenon]].  At this time, the refuges consisted of women, children and men too frail to fight.  They lived in fear, hiding in isolation from the constant pressure of [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]].  [[Ammenon]] had larger concerns, showing little interest in exterminating some of the final survivors of his scourge, and only applied minimal effort in the endeavor.  This allowed them to carve out what started as a meager existence.

The surviving women of The Elden Reaches became a symbol of resilience and strength, standing alone against the remnants of [[Vaecnan Forces|The Vaecnan Dynasty]].  Notable female figures such as [[Petronia Adventa]] and [[Poulcheria]] emerged from this region, becoming beacons of inspiration.  The people of The Elden Reaches cherish their history and express devotion to their historical figures by naming buildings, erecting shrines, and creating statues in their honor

!The Sisters Of The Blood And Shield
The Elden Reaches embrace a matriarchal society, where women hold positions of prominence and authority.  This cultural shift dates back to the founding of the region.  [[The Sisters Of The Blood And Shield]] are a venerated order of skilled warrior-women.  Founded to protect their homeland against the threat of [[Ammenon]], [[The Sisters|The Sisters Of The Blood And Shield]] are known for their unwavering dedication and unique combat style.  Each village in The Reaches has its own band of warriors, each employing a distinctive fighting style.

[[The Sisters Of The Blood And Shield]] use retractable metal shields as part of their combat techniques.  Their primary focus is not on strength but on using their opponents' force against them.  They are expertly trained to fight in coordinated groups, providing both mental and physical support to each other on and off the battlefield.  [[The Sisters|The Sisters Of The Blood And Shield]] do not take kindly to training men in their style, believing men are incapable of learning it as they are too aggressive and unyielding.</pre>

The Elder Gods do not demand or require servitude.  However, those that follow them (known as [[Warlocks|Warlock]]) are able to draw on immense magical power.  While there exist [[Warlocks|Warlock]] who attempt to use the power of The Elder Gods for good, the mortal mind is almost always driven insane by a prolonged connection with such an alien intelligence.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/the-fountains-of-creation/earth/plane-of-earth.jpg]]

The Elemental Plane Of Earth is one of [[The Fountains Of Creation]], a [[Plane Of Existence|The Planes Of Existence]] that is a paradox world where the ground and sky are dotted with mountains and soil. Gravity works strangely here, and the substances of the plane are constantly moving in a slow, grinding motion punctuated by earthquakes and small tremors to massive violent upheavals. [[The Iron Crucible]] is a city of [[Seraph]] built near a large fountain of liquid metal.

!The Primordial Xiphais
It was [[Azarad-Ji]] who killed [[Xiphais]], the earth [[Primordial]] [[Titan]] during [[The Second Age]].  He consumed [[Xiphais]] upon awakening from imprisonment in his weakened state, in order to return to his peak power.  [[Xiphais]] was considered one of the strongest of the [[Primordials|Primordial]], causing the most devastation during [[The Cataclysm]] of [[The First Desecration]].  It is said that [[Xiphais]] carved what is known as [[The Underdark]] during this time.  After the demise of [[Xiphais]], The Elemental Plane Of Earth was unbalanced from his absence and formed a young [[Titan]] named [[Everon]].  It is [[The Great Khan]] of the [[Dao]], [[Kabril Ali al-Sara al-Zalizi]] who sees the creature is tended to; however they are struggling to keep it alive.  [[Everon]] requires something that the [[Seraph]] aren't providing, and continually dies and is resurrected by the plane itself, forever trapped in adolescence.

!The Basalt Crucible
[[The Great Khan]] of the [[Dao]], [[Kabril Ali al-Sara al-Zalizi]], The Fountain Of Wealth, The Perfect Compass, Atamen Of The Mountain's Roots lives within the fortress known as [[The Basalt Crucible]].  The fortress is located by a large fountain of liquid metal known as [[The Fulcrum]].  [[Koh Nur]], or [[The Mountain Of Light|Koh Nur]] is a giant opal at the top of a tall stone tower of [[The Basalt Crucible]].  It sheds light that illuminates the plane and serves as a method of timekeeping for the realm.  Twice a day [[Koh Nur]] would change color, from a light orange to a rich purple.  All light from [[Koh Nur]] is reflected from the many gemstones and crystals found throughout the entire plane.

!Flora and Fauna
The most feared creature in The Elemental Plane Of Earth is the [[Purple Worm]].  They share a hive mind known as [[Ogrémoch]].  Even the [[Seraph]] can't communicate with them or comprehend them.  They are both respected and revered.

!The Fein Of The Stone
[[The Fein Of The Stone]], from the [[Druidic|Druid]] order known as [[The Ashai]] have a settlement here known as [[Core]].  It is fortified settlement near [[The Vulcanfell Rift]], settled in 1026 [[AAP]] by [[Rujad Menedemos]] who felt it was easier to protect the breach from within the elemental plane itself.</pre>

<pre>The Holnobalga (Translated from [[Elvish]] as &quot;The Emerald Order&quot;) is a decree issued by the [[Elf]] [[Goldarina Elaniessee]] right before [[The Third Desecration]].  His name means &quot;Emerald Star&quot;, and he was an official of some standing in the city of [[Rhestatolo]].  His order was first issued when [[The Grey Companions]], caught in a magical vortex that caused them to temporally jump, informed [[Goldarina Elaniessee]] that they had meddled with [[The Eternal Cycle]].  Since that time, a group of ardent followers have expanded their mission to include the prevention of the hubris and curiosity that led to the fall of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  Their ideology is that [[Desecration]] is brought on by the over-reaching of society in a quest to understand and become more like [[The Gods]].

The Emerald Order censors the teaching and practicing of many forms of advanced [[Magic]] or science aimed at unlocking the deeper mysteries of [[Asha]].  Their unrelenting quest to root out subversive behavior leads to questionable tactics of imprisonment when individuals are not cooperative.  The group's focus is to specifically prevent society from [[breaking the world again|Desecration]].

<pre>This shop is located in [[The Candlekeep District]] of the city of [[Zylok]], a three story brown stone located in a quiet alcove of the city.  It is a well known and quite reputable shop that sells all of the things that a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] may require.  The shop does business with [[The Athenaeum]] as well as it's students.

The outside of the building is marked by a heroic monument of a robed [[Wizard|Wizardry]], hewn from stone.  The statue is said to be of the famed [[Amonite]] [[Wizard|Wizardry]] [[Beresko]], but the facial features have long worn away making it impossible to know for certain.  The statue has an arm outstretched, clasping a staff as if in the middle of an incantation, with the tip of the staff lit by continual flames.  This lights a sign that hangs crookedly from the staff which reads &quot;The Emporium Arcana&quot;.

Inside, you'll find the proprietor [[Madelyn Bondar]] - a slight [[Human]] female [[Wizard|Wizardry]] with short brown hair and big round spectacles perched on her nose.  She favors dressing in pastel casual clothing and a beanie.  She is most definitely not one for manual labor, and will use [[Magic]] even for the most mundane of tasks.  She is friendly, and takes great pride in her store and products.  Her [[Familiar]] [[Moptop]] is a blonde [[Monkey]] who is always nearby and helping out around the store.  He is often seen perched on a windowsill watching a boiling cauldron to assist with potion making.

The interior of the first floor has two sets of spiral stairs going to the upper floors, a large display of books and scrolls, as well as a large window that takes up the majority of the back wall.  This window is magical and known as [[The Window Of The Worlds]].  Despite the fact that the back of the shop stands against just another dusty alley of the city, the window points to somewhere else entirely.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/gods/the-eternal-cycle.jpg]]
The Eternal Cycle is the philosophy that all of existence has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form an infinite number of times across infinite time and space.  Everything is governed by the laws of The Eternal Cycle, even [[The Elder Gods]] themselves.

While individuals have and retain free-will, The Eternal Cycle spins like a great wheel and for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction that endeavors to create equilibrium.  [[The Gods]] take pleasure in this comfort, whereas some entities like [[Azarad-Ji]] chafe at the thought that their actions are being countered.  However, The Eternal Cycle has no intent in its actions; it is a force of the natural cosmos.

The Eternal Cycle has strange effects on the mortal [[Races]] with no lasting memory of time, creating patterns and themes that can be seen repeated over [[Ages|History]].  History begins to repeat itself for them: civilizations rising and falling; charismatic leaders arriving in times of great need; and discovery of thought and knowledge of what was once lost in another [[Age|History]].

[[Desecration]] is the name of an act that subverts The Eternal Cycle and works with an intent to undo it.  The [[Elf]] [[Raime Wesewierë]] was the author of the [[BahaUlla Prophecy]] - a story of how the struggles of the universe will end.</pre>

<pre>The Fair Folk are the most renowned classification of [[Fey]] creatures that are found within [[The Feywild]].  They embody the archetype of beauty, grace, and charm that is often associated with the inhabitants of this mystical realm.  These [[Fey]] are considered the epitome of elegance and sophistication, their presence exuding an aura of otherworldly allure.  The Fair Folk are often closely associated with the various [[Courts Of The Feywild|Archfey]], where their natural charisma and refined manners make them central figures in courtly life.

Despite their name, not all Fair Folk are conventionally &quot;fair&quot; in appearance.  Some have been marred by curses, transforming their once-beautiful forms into something grotesque.  However, this loss of beauty does not strip them of their status or power within [[The Feywild]].  Instead, it often amplified their cunning, wisdom, or malevolence, making them formidable beings within their own right.

!Notable Fair Folk Races

<div title="The Faith Of The Ten" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202109130123" modified="202212021603" tags="religion" changecount="25">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/organizations/the-faith-of-the-ten-symbol.jpg]]
The Faith Of The Ten is a [[Draconic|Dragon]] [[Religion]] of the [[Dragonborn]] of [[Caldoria]].  It is more of a way of life than it is a [[Religion]], as there is no organized worship.  Those of the faith revere ancestors and elders, for failing to do so causes irreparable damage to ones [[Soul]].

!The First Daar
The Faith Of The Ten holds as its core belief that a [[Dragon's|Dragon]] [[Soul]] (or &quot;Daar&quot; in [[Draconic]]) is eternal.  If it is properly remembered and worshiped, it will join with its ancestors (or &quot;Kama&quot; in [[Draconic]]) which will one day be reborn.  All [[Dragonborn]] see their [[Souls/Daar|Soul]] as being those of [[Dragons|Dragon]].

!The First Dragons
The first [[Dragon]] to exist in [[Asha]] was [[Tyrnus]]; a [[Dragon]] comprised of 10 heads.  It was during [[The First Desecration]] when she found herself displaced here; with no knowledge of how to return home.  The environment began to quickly change her, until she split apart into two entities referred to as her children: [[Bahamut]] and [[Tiamat]].  Each bore 5 of their mother's heads; [[Bahamut]] the gold, silver, bronze, copper, and brass and [[Tiamat]] red, blue, white, black, and green.

The Faith Of The Ten holds [[Tyrnus]], [[Bahamut]], and [[Tiamat]] in high regard; for their [[Souls|Soul]] descend from them.  It was early in [[The Second Age]] when [[Tiamat]] and [[Bahamut]] learned how to sacrifice a piece of themselves in order to create what are today known as [[Dragons|Dragon]].  It was during this time where [[Bahamut]] and [[Tiamat]] began their eternal feud.

!The Dragonborn Spirit
To the [[Dragonborn]], family ties are of the utmost importance, as without family and friends to remember you after your death you will become a tormented vengeful spirit.  The [[Dragonborn]] believe that without family and friends, one is not truly alive.
When a [[Dragonborn]] dies, their [[Soul]] or [[Tala]] in [[Draconic]] departs the body at death and floats upon the winds for 49 years.  The living must remember the deceased during this time, and if they do so well, the [[Soul]] joins their ancestor's [[Kami]].  If they do not, the [[Tala]] becomes vengeful and will torment the living.
Homes typically have an altar with idols dedicated to respected ancestors and is the center of family worship.  This altar is often found in a main room facing the front door.  Daily sacrifices of food, incense and wine are offered to the family ancestors, who are considered household gods.  These ancestors (known as [[Kami]] or &quot;Watchers&quot;) are connected to an enormous celestial bureaucracy.  Household gods silently, dutifully, and invisibly protect a family from misfortune and illness, and are appealed to by the family for blessings of fertility, wealth, family harmony and well-being.  These household gods watch over the family as best they can.

!Practices And Rites
*''The Rite of Hatching'' - when a [[Dragonborn]] hatchling first emerges from it's shell, it is given a name of a deceased ancestor.  It is believed that the named ancestor watches over the newborn until it comes of age.
*''The Rite of Childhood'' - upon weaning from their caregivers and walking, the mother burns a cloth fresh with the child's blood and chooses a nickname for the child.
* ''The Rite Of Adulthood'' - upon reaching puberty, a [[Dragonborn]] chooses their adult name.  This is customary to be done in the holy city of [[Ansapis]] inside [[The Pyramid Of Tyrnus]].
* ''The Rite of Marriage'' - marriage is customary to occur during [[The Festival of the Moon and Wind]], as a community.  Brides and Grooms are expected to stay in seclusion from each other and pray to the [[Kami]] for blessings for the duration of the festival, while the community celebrates.
* ''The Rite Of Childbirth'' - When a mother has her first clutch of eggs, they are granted the title of [[Matron]] and are increased in social standing.
* ''The Rite of Death'' - death is an elaborate ceremony, with the body cleansed and kept for visitation for up to one week.  Following, the body is cremated and the ashes are placed within the family shrine with their ancestors.

!The Holy City Of Ansapis
The holy city of [[Ansapis]] in [[Caldoria]] remains a beacon to the [[Dragonborn]] who are devout followers of The Faith Of The Ten.  [[The Pyramid Of Tyrnus]] is the largest building within the city, and acts as a storehouse and memorial for lost [[Dragonborn]] spirits who cannot be remembered by individual families and clans.  There are no organized services or anointed leaders within [[The Pyramid Of Tyrnus]], as The Faith Of The Ten is not an organized religion - it is a place of quiet solitude and meditation.</pre>

<pre>Thev Fein Of Stone is a sect of [[The Ashai]], an ancient order of [[Druids|Druid]].  They tend to the sacred places of [[Asha]] with a connection to [[The Elemental Plane Of Earth]].  Those of The Fein Of Stone are often more assertive in preserving the balance and order within [[The Fountains Of Creation]], and have even established an outpost on the other side of [[The Vulcanfell Rift]] known as [[Core]].

The Fein has a small village on the precipice of [[Mount Coaldon]], an inactive volcano within [[The Vulcanfell Mountains]] deep within the wilderness of [[The Vulcanfell Highlands]].  It is there that [[The Vulcanfell Rift]] is located - a weak point between [[The Material Plane]] and [[The Elemental Plane Of Earth]].

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/the-ferryman/the-ferryman.jpg]]
Sailor's are a superstitious bunch, and one of the many tales told is that of The Ferryman.  A former cabin boy mistreated by his captain, who plunged himself into the ocean rather than suffer fate aboard the ship.  Deep beneath the waves he gained some mystical power and returned to kill the captain.

If you are desperate, he can be called if your ship is about to be lost, be it becalmed and adrift, sundered in a storm, or pillaged by pirates.  His price is steep:

{{quote{
//Thee drops of blood.//
//Two coins.//
//One [[Soul]], willingly given.//
}}}

The [[Soul]] need not be your own, as long as it is offered willingly.  If he heeds your call, he will quiet the rolling sea and bend the winds to his will.  He will guide your ship to safe harbor, or outrun storms and buccaneers alike.  It is said that The Ferryman may take the [[Soul]] at anytime; and may come calling for his just due.  Those who have made such a bargain are shunned.  Who would trust someone who's [[Soul]] is already forfeit?

The Festival Of The Moon And Wind is a holiday in [[Asha]] celebrated by the [[Dragonborn]] of [[Caldoria]].  It is celebrated on the 23rd of [[Horisal]] according to [[The Viridian Calendar]].  The festival honors ancestors, life and love.  It is customary to light a paper lantern for each loved one who has passed on, and during the three day festival thousands of lights fly through the sky.

!A Celebration Of Love
The festival is a time for love.  It is a customary time for [[Dragonborn]] to marry during the festival, where the betrothed each stay in isolation deep in meditation while the family celebrates.  Young [[Dragonborn]] who are of age are chaperoned in the streets in hopes of finding love.  Matchmakers act busily in hopes of pairing couples.

!A Celebration Of Rebirth
On the final day of the celebration, [[Dragonborn]] launch a final lantern that symbolizes letting go of their past self, and starting anew; renewed by ones ancestors.  It is thought that all sins can be redeemed during the festival.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/the-feywild/the-feywild.jpg]]
The Feywild is one of [[The Planes Of Existence]]; a sister plane to [[The Material Plane]] in what scholars refer to as one of [[The Echo Planes]].  Known by its inhabitants as &quot;The Bright&quot;, it is a magical wonder to all who lay eyes on its soil, [[Magic]] runs more freely in this plane and it pulses in the very air. Unless one can not be glamoured or is given the sight through another means, they can not help but be drawn to the beautiful chaos around them. In daylight, this charming magical land of wonder smells of fond dreams, candlelight, and of childhood hopes. Night brings the constant revelry and steady beating of drums where dancing seems most inviting. The luring song sings softly of days without worry and nights without fear. While this captivating land may seem perfect and pure, nothing is as it seems. Long peaceful days of dancing in the moonlight may be covering tear-stained faces and bleeding feet.

!The Nature Of The Feywild
The Feywild is built like a trap to bring unknowing victims into its web and use their mortality for entertainment among the lands. Accepting anything from a [[Fey]] would count as taking a gift from them, and in turn would put a creature in their debt which is something they never would want to have happen. One must tread carefully and listen more than they speak. Time run differently in the Feywild compared to [[The Material Plane]], and even a short visit to the Feywild could be equivalent to a year or a matter of minutes.

Names hold power.  Say a [[Fey's|Fey]] name in full and true power can hold them still. To avoid this mythical fate all the [[Archfey]] hold [[Elven|Elf]] names. In the rare case that someone comes across one of the [[Fair Folk|Fey]] they will be more than happy to give the information sought in exchange for any shiny thing in a pocket, they do not take unfair trades lightly. To save a [[Fey]] would put them in debt and they will try to find the quickest way out of the bargain.

!Elven Origins
[[Elves|Elf]] are [[Fey]] in origin, and [[Lucian]] created their spirits from the power within The Feywild.  While immortal, the [[Elves|Elf]] will long for a return to The Feywild where they ascend into being of pure spiritual energy.

!The Court Of Stars
A group of powerful entities known as [[Archfey]] collectively make up a noble hierarchy known as [[The Court Of Stars]].  Each [[Archfey]] are physical manifestations of a natural power, they are interconnected to The Feywild's existence.  The court is made up of [[The Summer Court]], [[The Winter Court]], [[The Spring Court]], [[The Autumn Court]], [[The Dawn Court]], [[The Dusk Court]], and [[The Court Of Stars]].

[[The Summer Court]] embodies the peak of life's energy, where nature thrives in all its glory.  It is a place where the air is filled with the heady scents of blooming flowers and ripening fruits, and the warmth of summer can be felt in every corner of the land. |

It is a land of lush forests, verdant rolling meadows, and clear bottomless lakes.  This is a wild realm that attracts many of [[The Shy Folk]] and [[Tall Folk|The Tall Folk]].  While this court does not boast large cities, there is a large central village which surrounds [[The Lord's Estate|Greenbough Keep]].  This village is known as [[The Eldergrove]].|

Once a place of harvest celebration and vibrant energy, [[The Autumn Court]] has since become a domain marked by sorrow, vengeance, and the relentless pursuit of justice against those who wronged it. |

This court is ruled by the twin siblings, [[Lady Sebhana Alastai]] and [[Lord Elia Alastai]], who together embody the duality of their domain. [[The Dawn Court]] is a place where the depths of the ocean meet the shallows of rivers and lakes, where the first light of day touches the waves, and where the beauty of nature is reflected in the stillness of water. It is a realm of balance, where the calm and the tempest coexist in harmony.|

It is a domain where the boundary between dreams and reality is thin, a place of quiet and haunting beauty, where the light of day fades into the embrace of night, and the stars begin to shimmer in the sky.  The flora and fauna are uniquely adapted to this environment, with plants that glow softly in the dark and creatures that move silently through the shadows. |

The First Age is known as The Age Of Gods.  It was a time when Life flourished and shown so bright, only to so arrogantly attempted to usurp the power of [[The Creator]] - to their own demise.  Their folly loosened the binds of the dark one [[Azarad-Ji]] and nearly destroyed [[The Eternal Cycle]] itself, resulting in [[The First Desecration]].  Only legends exist of this Age, crafted from fragments of hazy images wrested from [[The Eternal Cycle]] itself by sorcerers.

The First Age was a time before [[Magic]], before [[The Gods]] as they are currently known.  A time in which [[mankind|Human]] ruled over nature with technology and science.  This age was modern-day Earth, before [[The First Desecration]] ended everything and gave birth to other [[Races]], [[Dimensions]], and [[Magic]].

!Legends
The legends that have been gleaned through magic have a starting resemblance to real-world Earth history.
* The story of &quot;good King Ham who mournfully warred with his own brother in order to bring peace&quot; resembles Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War.
* &quot;The Dark Lord Adler whose genocidal scourge brought the world to war was defeated on the backs of an army of giant birds&quot; is most likely depicting Adolf Hitler in World War II, with the birds being aircraft.
* &quot;Feld, the jester, whose performances could make the world weep with joy&quot; is clearly the comedian Jerry Seinfeld.
* Readers will note that the legend of &quot;The folly of the Gods when they created an eye that could pierce into the inner recesses of the universe itself, only to find something peering back&quot; has similarities to The Hubble Telescope that is used to explore the galaxy.
* &quot;The story of Ram, and how he alone could stop large armies with the skill of his bow and knife&quot; appears to be the fictional character from the movie &quot;Rambo&quot;
* &quot;In an effort to unlock the secrets and power of [[The Creator]], so ended The First Age when they instead unraveled [[The Eternal Cycle]] itself, and therein loosened the binds of [[Azarad-Ji]]&quot; was most definitely The Large Hadron Collidor [LHC].
* &quot;The story of how every living being on the planet was connected in heart and mind&quot; telling of the Internet

!Artifacts
No artifacts from The First Age are known to exist, so much turmoil and change has occurred to have wipe out evidence from this Age.  Unbeknownst to the world and to it's owner, [[Abram Unger]] owns photographs that date to this age.  They are fuzzy and difficult to make out.

Unbeknownst to those of [[The Fourth Age]], [[The First Age]] was was also a time of [[Mankind|Human]].  The events of this age parallels that of modern Earth history.  The exploration of the theories of creation itself causes a tear in the dimensional fabric which nearly causes the extinction of [[Mankind|Human]].  Scientists stabilize the tear, ending [[The First Age]].  However the resulting upheaval, known as [[The Cataclysm]], engulfs the majority of the [[next age|The Second Age]] and reduces [[humanity|Human]] to a single scattered cluster that they won't recover from until [[The Fourth Age]].

Very little is known of this time - a time before magic.  What scraps and fragments that can be uncovered are only legends.</pre>

<div title="The Fisher's League" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="201507020100" modified="202211261310" tags="city" changecount="65">
<pre>The Fisher's League is a loose confederation of 10 towns found within the region of [[The Viridian Empire]] of [[Kellos]] known as [[The Coast]].  The cities are arranged along the shores of [[Lake Mistmoor]].  They trace their history back to 10 [[Kellish|Kell]] kings who settled here prior to [[The Amoni Invasion]], and are still sometimes referred to as [[The Lake Kingdoms]] even though they have all pledged their allegiance to [[The Viridian Empire]].

| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-coast/the-fishers-league/akhita-anagalmeshu-portrait.jpg][Akhita Anagalmeshu]] &lt;br&gt;[[Akhita Anagalmeshu]] |__[[Akhita Anagalmeshu]]__ is the [[Lady]] [[Shield]] of The Fisher's League, [[Reeve]] of [[Derby]] and [[Bannerwoman|Bannerman]] to [[House Bryne]].  She is the charming and outspoken head of [[House Anagalmeshu]].  Her family can trace its roots back to the earliest [[Uskardeen|Uskard]] refugees that came to [[Kellos]] during [[The Destruction Of Uskard]].  [[Akhita|Akhita Anagalmeshu]] is the only surviving heir to [[Hour Anagalmeshu]], and her beauty and power attract countless suitors (both major and minor) bold enough to attempt to merge with her powerful [[House|Houses Of The Viridian Empire]].  [[Akhita Anagalmeshu]] is one of the most charismatic figures within the lake kingdoms, with long black hair, brown skin and gleaming emerald eyes.|

!The Heart Of The Empire
The Fisher's League has had a significant history of being the beating heart of [[The Viridian Empire]], with its central location as a trading hub.  In recent years, with the invention of the [[Airship]], the towns have played a less central role.  However, trade still remains active due to the cost of air travel.

!Coopetition
While life within each of the ten city exemplifies a camaraderie and partnership for the betterment of the whole Fisher's League, there exists a fierce competitive spirit with the relations between the cities.  The fisherman fight for competitive fishing rights to the most prime locations on [[Lake Mistmoor]] to catch [[Krall]], and families have been known to split for moving to other towns.

!The Lighthouses
Each major city along the shore of [[Lake Mistmoor]] has a lighthouse, to help guide ships through the thick fog of [[Lake Mistmoor]].  These beacons can be seen across the large lake, and used as a means of communication.

!The Ten Cities Of The Lake Kingdoms
| [img[images/locations/kellos/the-coast/derby-preview.jpg][Derby]] &lt;br&gt;[[Derby]] |[[Derby]] is the largest city of [[The Fisher's League]], known for being a trading center and lifeline for trade of goods for [[The Keep]]. It is famous for [[The Siege Of Derby]] in which [[a rogue house|House Conlon]] blockaded the shipment of trade goods as protest to  [[Emperor]] [[Jacob Jedaleon III]] spurning the marriage to [[Lara Conlon]].  The city is home to [[The Palace Of The Divine]], a holy temple on the top of a large hill; a focus of pilgrimage for those devout in [[The Divine Order]]. |
| [img[images/locations/kellos/the-coast/lakewood-preview.jpg][Lakewood]] &lt;br&gt;[[Lakewood]] |[[Lakewood]] is the second largest city on [[Lake Mistmoor]], however over the many years it was constrained with the means to grow based upon the rocky soil, location, and foothills of the mountains.  Instead, the townsfolk began to expand their city into floating platforms in the shallow portions of the lake. The city is rather plain, and made of wood; something they take pride in over the overly &quot;fancy&quot; city of [[Derby]]. |
| [img[images/locations/kellos/the-coast/bridgebay-preview.jpg][Bridgebay]] &lt;br&gt;[[Bridgebay]] |[[Bridgebay]] is the city that sits on the mouth of [[The Kelerion River]] that enters into [[Lake Mistmoor]].  While not as large as the other cities along [[the lake|Lake Mistmoor]], [[Bridgebay]] serves a critical role in operating the bridge that crosses the river which is powered by a [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] made waterwheel to allow portions of the bridge to life when large ships sail down the river. |
| [img[images/locations/kellos/the-coast/elderhelm-preview.jpg][Elderhelm]] &lt;br&gt;[[Elderhelm]] |[[Elderhelm]] long since gave up competing for fishing rites, and instead focused on institutions of knowledge and learning.  The town of [[Elderhelm]] is a quiet retreat for [[Wizards|Wizardry]] and [[Sorcerers|Sorcery]] who seek a place to retire in comfort and peace.  Their library is said to only be bested by [[The Athenaeum]] itself. Canals run throughout the town, making it just as easy to travel by boat as it is to walk. |
| [img[images/locations/kellos/the-coast/highshire-preview.jpg][Highshire]] &lt;br&gt;[[Highshire]] |[[Highshire]] has a high population of [[Bairn]], as many centuries ago it was a [[Bairn]] community.  As civilization grew up around [[Lake Mistmoor]], so to did the community grow into the city it is today.  [[Highshire]] has [[Bairn]] influences deep within its architecture, with round doors and roundish adornments. Life in [[Highshire]] is filled with celebrations and festivities; other towns on [[the lake|Lake Mistmoor]] tend to see those from [[Highshire]] as frivolous or lazy. |
| [img[images/locations/kellos/the-coast/whitecliff-preview.jpg][Whitecliff]] &lt;br&gt;[[Whitecliff]] |[[Whitecliff]] is named for the sheer white cliffs of the mountainous terrain that surrounds the town.  The town has mines of marble and precious gems, which it trades across [[The Viridian Empire]].  The economy of the town is declining, due to a lack of skilled tradesmen and miners.  Taking advantage of the downtrodden economy, the local [[Reeve]], [[Marley Hawkins]] has begun to stir the populace into action. |
| [img[images/locations/kellos/the-coast/anchorpointe-preview.jpg][Anchorpointe]] &lt;br&gt;[[Anchorpointe]] |[[Anchorpointe]] is quickly growing in size, due to its recent addition of an [[Airship]] dock.  This has caused the city to become a transition hub of good across multiple modes of travel.

| [img[images/locations/kellos/the-coast/unity-preview.jpg][Unity]] &lt;br&gt;[[Unity]] |[[Unity]] is a community of craftspeople and artisans.

It is a small town that was built around an ancient castle that dates back to [[The First Men]] of [[The Second Age]].  Only a small number of people live here, but they are the most savvy fishermen on the [[Lake|Lake Mistmoor]]. The town's name comes from the name of the [[Kellish|Kell]] tribe who occupied these lands prior to [[The Amoni Invasion]]. |
| [img[images/locations/kellos/the-coast/edgewater-preview.jpg][Edgewater]] &lt;br&gt;[[Edgewater]] |[[Edgewater]] has a thriving economy of timber production, wine brewing, and fishing.  But their biggest strengths are [[Alchemy]] and intricate fletching techniques.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/organizations/the-followers-of-joro-symbol.jpg]]

The Followers Of Joro began as a small group of individuals within the city of [[Laranor]] circa 995-997 [[AAP]], following the teachings of [[Gavar Joro]].  After [[Gavar Joro]]'s untimely death, belief in his idea that the universe was ruled by [[One True God]] began to spread.  [[Gavar Joro]] believed that [[The Eternal Cycle]] could be broken, and a new world of hope and prosperity could exist.  This belief mirrors [[BahaUlla Prophecy]] of [[The Sylvan Empire]].

!Teachings Of Joro
[[Gavar Joro]] had visions and prophecies of the past and future, and wrote of many fantastical things.  His teachings to this day are still undecipherable to even his most ardent of followers.  Some of the more confusing prophecies include:

* The city by the sea
* Chivasso will plot for the eagle
* The great tomb of the people
* in the land of the mountain people
* when the eclipse of the sun will then be
* the monster will be seen in full day
* the willing blow will put out his eye
* the five strangers entered the temple, their blood will come to pollute the land
* the tree which had long been dead and withered.  It one night will come to grow green again
* two brothers will wage war so fiercely
* a serpent seen near the royal bed, it will be by the lady at night, the dogs will not bark
* the moon is obscured in deep gloom
* his brother becomes bright red in color
* the great one hidden for a long time in the shadows will hod the blade in the bloody wound
* the children of the morning
* near the gates and within two cities there will be two scourges the likes of which was never seen
* famine within plague, people put out by steel, crying to the creator for relief
* beasts ferocious from hunger will swim across rivers.  
* The greater part of the region will be against the hister.  The great one will cause it to be dragged in an iron cage</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/history/the-age-of-man.jpg]]

The Fourth Age, also known as &quot;The Age Of Man&quot; is the current age in [[Asha's|Asha]] [[History]].  It began after the fall of [[The Sylvan Empire]] in 2127 [[IO]] and is chiefly dominated by the rise of [[Human]] civilization.  While their lifespan's are shorter than those of other races, the [[Humans|Human]] have an insatiable appetite for expansion and progress - and in a small amount of time have accomplished much.

!The Amoni Invasion
While [[Humanity|Human]] clung to existence in fragmented tribal clans across the globe, it was in [[Amon]] where one of the first [[Human]] civilizations flourished and grew.  From the ashes of a shattered empire from [[The Second Age]], [[Amon]] rose as a dominant force on the planet.  They built large sailing vessels and explored many of the far reaches of [[Asha]].  Upon finding the vast untapped resources of [[Kellos]], [[Amon]] launched a campaign to claim the untamed lands for themselves - known simply as [[The Amoni Invasion]] led by the [[Amoni]] military leader [[Tarmon Gellius]]

!The Destruction Of Uskard
[[Uskard]] was said to be a jewel, with lush jungles that were a deep verdant green.  The [[Humans|Human]] that made there home here called themselves the [[Uskardeen]], and built a civilization based on [[Magic]].  A cataclysm in 29 [[IO]] saw [[The Destruction Of Uskard]], where thousands of [[Uskardeen]] found refuge in [[Kellos]].

!The Demon Plague
[[The Demon Plague]] was a pandemic of [[Magical|Magic]] origin in the region of [[Kellos]] during 24 [[IO]].  A group calling itself [[The Holy Scourge]] using [[Blood Magic]] attempted to bring about a new [[Desecration]].  This event saw to the birth of [[The Viridian Empire]] and started a scourge of anti-magic sentiment that saw to the [[Azutan Nagyos]] or &quot;The War Of Mages&quot;.  This war ended with a truce, and the creation of the organization known today as [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].

!The Raising Of Caldoria
[[Caldoria]] was a lost continent, sunk to the bottom of the ocean in [[The Second Age]] by [[Dragonborn]] elders.  In 1021 [[AAP]], [[The Grey Companions]] stumbled upon the sunken and lost civilization and assisted in raising it from the sea floor.  Today, many of the islands float about the sea supported by ancient [[Magic]].</pre>

<pre>The Garden Of Ashzun is a lush tropical paradise within the middle of the city of [[Anmanu]] on the floating continent of [[Caldoria]].  Trees provide shade to many raised beds of blue flowers known as [[Bluegloss]] that give off a sickly sweet smell.  The garden is tiered, with water slowly pouring from clay pipes in the walls, irrigating the garden beds.  [[The Children Of The Forge]] require these flowers as components for their rituals which extend their life.

The garden is shadowed by a grey ruin of a building known as [[The House Of The Eternal]], the seat of power for [[The Children Of The Forge]].  An archway in the back of the garden leads down a set of stairs into the darkness of the aqueduct where [[The Heart Of The Island]] can be found.</pre>

The Gates Of Elysium are located in [[Amoria]], the first layer of [[Elysium]] (a [[Plane Of Existence|The Planes Of Existence]]).  The Gates contain dimensional energy which allow for instantaneous travel across [[the planes|The Planes Of Existence]].  The gate was build by [[Kombar]] and used primarily by [[The Elysians|Elysian]] to guard and protect the domains nearby to [[Asha]].

!Capabilities
Transportation from The Gates uses a powerful, rainbow-like energy drawn from the universe itself.  This brilliant beam of energy shines down, leaving behind a rune-like pattern burned into the ground.  Ancient [[Humans|Human]] of [[The First Age]] witnessed the miracle of The Gates, and incorporated it into their legends of The Bifrost Bridge of Norse mythology, or The Pearly Gates of Christian Heaven - however, all of these legends are now lost to time.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/organizations/guantlet.jpg]]
The Gauntlet is a group of rough and tumble mercenaries that are headquartered in [[Bandor]].  They are known for their fearless and surgical style of executing their assignments.  The group is run by a council known as the ‘Heads’.  The Heads then inform the ‘Swords’, who are the approved members of The Gauntlet of upcoming jobs.  Swords can then elect whether they wish to participate in the posted job.  Heads determine who gets the job if there are too many applicants.

Swords have the authority to hire agents outside of the Gauntlet.  The Sword is then responsible for their payment and the fair treatment of his hirelings.  In this way, an older or crippled Sword may hire a party to complete a requested job.  These hirelings would most often then be offered their own membership within the Gauntlet.

The Gauntlet’s size is known only to the Heads.  However it is suspected that their numbers are small, for they only allow members who are elite mercenaries.  The members all wear the symbol of the chained fist on their shoulder, distinguishing their allegiance to one another. It is expected that all Gauntlet members act civilized and respectful when wearing the symbol.  The symbol generates an aura of respect, and is a mark of a seasoned warrior.  Members who act disrespectful when wearing the symbol are severely punished and face banishment from the group.

The Gauntlet will perform any task that is requested, even those that may seem morally dubious.  The price for hire is high if the Gauntlet is required to put their members life at risk, and higher still if the job is illegal.</pre>

It was forged from the bones of [[Azarad-Ji's|Azarad-Ji]] conquered enemies, most notably the head of the [[Sphinx]] [[Takhara Atim Karoamat]].

[[Azarad-Ji]] abandoned the throne when he built a more fortified citadel within [[Nessus]].</pre>

She is impatient, and quick to action.  Her deep desire to impose order in the universe causes her to meddle with mortals more frequently that the other Gods.

<pre>The Golden Path is a distinct ideological practice of the [[Religion]] known as [[The Way]].  Practitioners follow strict ideological practices that differ from the other three paths.  Those that follow The Golden Path believe that there are no superior beings, only enlightened beings, and only through the difficult practice of action through inaction is balance achieved.  

!Action Through Inaction
Those that walk The Golden Path believe that without care, every action creates an equal and opposite reaction in the universe;  Beauty creates Ugliness, Kindness creates Hatred, and Learning creates Ignorance.  They seek to not go against the flow of nature, and seek to be like water.  Water does not resist or fight against obstacles put in its path, yet it wields the power to overcome these obstacles smoothly and consistently.  They strive to act without force, teach without verbosity, producing without possessing, creating without regard to result, and claiming nothing.

!Harmony &amp; Balance
First, one must seek harmony and balance within oneself.  Second, one must not use more energy than is needed.</pre>

<pre>!Introduction
The Fellowship is a collective of mages throughout [[Asha]], bound together by a simple philosophy and a common goal.  Their highest purpose is to advance the study of magic and expand their understanding of its unlimited potential. Among The Fellowship, personal differences are set aside in order for mages to pursue what is truly important.  First off, all mages of this collective are expected to assist one another in magical training.  It is expected that there be an open exchange of information between fellows.  Also, a fellow should never ignore another fellow’s reasonable request for aid.  

However, most fellows consider themselves students of an immense science.  Most do not consider themselves adventurers at all and are not going to involve themselves directly in a dangerous quest.  PC fellows should assume that the very powerful wizard that lives in the tower outside of town is probably busily involved in important study or great matters.  While he may point a PC in the right direction and give some useful advice, he probably won’t drop everything and join the party that’s on its way to kill a big bad guy.

Also, there is an understanding among the fellowship not to harm other members intentionally (outside of open war).  Of course there may be powerful wizards on both sides of a dispute.  Because they are fellows does not mean that they will not have to face each other.  Often in these situations, fellows hold a civilized (though sometimes extremely heated) parlay before battle.

Finally, hospitality is expected between fellows.  Nevertheless, fellows are cautious not to take advantage of their host (sometimes to the point that it is sickeningly polite and painful to watch).  If a Fellow refuses service to another fellow outright, he will gain a bad reputation among the Fellowship and eventually be shunned by it entirely.

Aptitude with [[Wizardry]] or [[Sorcery]] is the prerequisite for entry into the fellowship.  Also, a mage must be sponsored by an active fellow and have learned the spell Fellowship.

!Joining The Fellowship
Those interested in joining the Grand Fellowship of Mages must first find a sponsor.  This sponsor will then (if agreed) teach the [[Fellowship Spell]] to the new recruit - which is used to identify oneself as a member.  Those who don't follow the established code of honor (Never attack another Fellow unless in a fair, open duel; Always be polite and courteous to other Fellows; Never take advantage of another Fellow’s generosity) are shunned.

!Hidden Symbols
Members adorn their homes with discrete hidden symbols that declare the residence a promise of hospitality.  [[The Grand Fellowship of Mages]] is very secretive of their symbols and lore to outsiders, such that it is rare for the ability to read these symbols be given to anyone outside of their organization.  The symbols are drawn using spells, and are only visible by those that can detect magic.

!History Of The Fellowship
The Fellowship was formed thousands of years ago, in 24 [[IO]] during a troubled time known as [[The Demon Plague]].  When the plague had reached civilized lands, a great battle had been going on between [[Armondax]], the Wizard of Brimstone and [[Mysara]], Lady of Shadowy Depths. Both mages felt the cold grip of the plague destroying the very thing they were fighting one another for.  The two had no choice but face a truly evil enemy together.  Their differences and goals seemed petty in comparison.  The two great wizards used their magic to protect those not yet effected.  Together they could keep the monstrous humans at bay, but they couldn’t hold out indefinitely.  During the last days, when supplies had been running low, [[Fazar]] the Wizard Knight brought an army to support them.  The fight kept going until [[Waywill]] Lifehealer arrived with a group of healers.  It was when all four mages concentrated their efforts were they able to devise a powerful magic that would cure the plague.  Each carried the cure to the neighboring cities, and the cure began to spread.  The desecration of humanity had been saved by their efforts.  It was with these four that the fellowship began.  The group grew, incorporating other powerful wizards.  Originally they were known as [[The Fellowship of Grand Mages]].  They sought out the most powerful [[wizards|Wizardry]] around the world to join their pursuit of knowledge and end the bitter rivalry that was common among them.  During this time [[Mysara]] and [[Armondax]] had a son, and when he was initiated into the fellowship he began initiating any noble mage he could find.  Apprentices and Archmages alike, made the fellowship great.  It was renamed The Grand Fellowship Of Mages, as all agreed that it was the fellowship that was great, not the individual mage.

The Green Maiden's Faire is an elite troupe of entertainers found within the city of [[Tszanthus]] on the continent of [[Ruje]].  They are the premier entertainers within the city, and are sought after by the [[Aurum]] of [[The Sodenward]].  The hallmark of The Green Maiden's Faire lies in its distinctive performers - masked artists who, while they never utter a word, speak volumes through their mesmerizing acts.  Each trouper is cloaked in vibrant costumes that evoke the essence of forest spirits.

!Silent Storytellers
The Green Maiden's Faire defies convention by employing silence as their most eloquent form of expression.  Instead of dialogue, they weave stories through graceful dance, intricate juggling, daring acrobatics, and awe inspiring fire-eating displays.  Audiences find themselves enraptured, drawn into a realm where imagination reigns supreme.

!The Paragon Theater
The Green Maiden's Faire has a residency within [[The Paragon Theater]] within [[The Upper Streap]] of [[Tszanthus]]

!Hidden linkage to Breagen Datha
Carefully hidden beneath their costumes is a secret that each trouper if a [[Draugaira]] [[Elf]].  They use their gracefulness to entertain and beguile.  Hidden further still is the connection to the [[Breagan Datha]], the elite assassins who run [[The Council Of Thieves]].</pre>

The Grey Book is a tome the [[The Grey Companions]] use to record the deeds of all past members.  Each member has a page dedicated to who they are, how they joined, and how they either fell in battle or were forced to leave the group due to age or infirmity.  The book is only available to members of the elite group.

The book's cover is exquisitely made.  It has a hard leather-binding, inlaid with a black onyx gemstone, and gold filigree.  The cover is green scale hide from an unknown reptilian creature (assumed to be a dragon).  It includes a silver clasp and strapping.

On the first page of the book reads the creed of [[The Grey Companions]]:
//Hear my words and bear witness to my vow.  I am the sentry that guards the realm, I am the warden of the seeds of chaos, I am the light that darkness fears, I am the torrent of power I unleash upon my foes.  We will strike the final blow, for only death can remove us from our steadfast course.  Power.  Restraint.  Sacrifice.//

The Grey Companions is the name of an ancient order that has history stretching back nearly 3000 years ago to the times of [[The Amoni Invasion]].  At that time, The Companions were a small elite force loyal to the leader of the invasion [[Tarmon Gellius]].  With the help of The Companions, he conquered and civilized the lands of [[Kellos]] and brought order and law that still stand to this day.

After the death of [[Tarmon Gellius]], The Companions became a private guild of adventurers for hire.  They have always been based in what is now known as the city of [[Brand]] in [[The Stone Lands]].  While they have no formal political allegiances, they have always stood for honor and protection of the less fortunate of the realm.  Their deeds are legendary, and have tremendous favor and respect from the common folk.

Gaining membership into the group is quite difficult, as they are quite particular as to the nature of those that seek to join.  Individuals must posses the potential of greatness, must be willing to place the good of the group above themselves, and must adhere to the strict code of The Companions (Never disparage yourself or the honor of The Grey Companions or minimize your strength or power, Never desert a comrade in need, Never withdraw on allegiance once granted, Never fear to hurt another in a just cause)

[[The Grey Book]] is a tome the group uses to record the deeds of all of its past members.

The Guild Of Illuminators is a prestigious and enigmatic society of [[Artificers|Artificer]] originally founded by [[Kazimir Angelus Nikomedes]] of [[Tszanthus]] in [[Hassomir]] 1180 / 938 [[AAP]] to protect the knowledge and power of [[Artifice]].  The Guild is known to go to great lengths to guard it's secrets from getting into the wrong hands, even to the extent of murder.

Renowned for their exceptional craftsmanship and mastery over [[Artifice]], the Illuminators are among the foremost authorities on these arcane disciplines.

The Guild has two prominent chapter houses, [[The Illuminator Chapter House Of Tszanthus]], and [[The Illuminator Chapter House Of Dravar]].

<pre>The Hall Of Thrones is the political seat of power in [[Caldoria]] located within the center of the city of [[Anmanu]].  It is a towering citadel with a grand audience chamber.  Outside the Hall is a large open forum with a row of five pillars on each side of a set of stairs leading to the main building on top of a hill.  On each pillar stands a statue of a [[Dragonborn]] roughly one and a half times their natural size.  Each is carved from a unique stone or metal (Obsidian, Jade, Alabaster, Lapis Lazuli, Ruby, Silver, Bronze, Gold, Copper and Brass) representing the ten scale colors of the [[Dragonborn]].  They represent a [[Dragonborn Elder]] of that color who is held in high respect and honor.

The Hall serves as the seat of power for [[the pure-blood Council Of Elders|The Council Of Elders]].  Ten [[Elders|Dragonborn Elders]], purest of the draconian lineage sit and confer silently to direct the course of events on behalf of [[Caldoria]].

The citadel boasts tall and delicate round white spires capped with colorful tiled roofs and topped with waving banners.  Two heavy doors grant entrance to the main chamber; a cavernous audience chamber with pillars holding up a cathedral ceiling.

The Hegemony is the presiding government of the continent of [[Ruje]].  There are 8 freeholds in The Hegemony each ruled by an [[Octarch]] that sit upon a governing body known as [[The Manticore Court]]; their symbol being a [[Manticore's|Manticore]] barb with 8 spikes.  They prefer autonomy of their own regions, and only loosely work together to ensure the overall safety of The Hegemony.  [[The Manticore Court]] is chaired by the most senior [[Octarch]] whose title raises to [[Primarch]] (first among many).

The governing law is an ancient legal system known as [[The Iron Law]] which is wrought with corruption and cruelty.

!The Eight Freeholds of The Hegemony
The Eight Freeholds Of The Hegemony are located on the continent of [[Ruje]].  They have a sorted history full of struggle and rebellion, having been founded as colonies of [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]] in [[The Third Age]].  They have been conquered, reestablished, refounded, and reconstructed over countless conflicts and natural disasters.  The region is fraught with danger, with the eight cities acting as points of light in the unforgiving wilderness.  [[The Moonsea]] contains colossal predators that make sailing difficult without the aid of the [[Kuo-Toa]].

Ruled by a loose federation known as The Hegemony, each city is self governed and ruled by an [[Primarch]].  The Hegemony keeps time using [[The Rujevian Calendar]].  The Freeholds are the only known bastions of civilization in these parts, perched upon the coast of [[The Moonsea]] affectionately known as [[The Menagerie Coast]].  These cities act as beacons of light and hope in a region of otherwise wilderness and savagery.  [[The Rujevian]] who live here rarely leave the comfort of their cities due to the danger that lurks beyond their walls.  [[Port Merona]] is the only city of the eight to exist on the mainland of [[Ruje]], the remaining cities are spread across a large island chain known as [[The Crescent Archipelago]].

It's culture most similarly mirrors [[Amon]], and there is significant trading between the two nations.  It is a city of splendor.  Travel further south and deeper into The Freeholds is difficult for foreigners, as [[The Moonsea]] is treacherous for those who are unfamiliar with its waters.  The city is known as &quot;Many Points Of Light&quot; due to the number of forges lit within the city.  They are renowned weapon and armor smiths.   |
| [img[images/locations/ruje/dravar-preview.jpg][Dravar]] &lt;br&gt;[[Dravar]] |[[Dravar]] is most known for its beaches made of small shells instead of sand.  The local [[Quori]] closely guard the secret for crushing the shells into [[Dravarian Silver Sand]] which they can smelt and weave into either flexible or rigid glass.  It is the richest city of [[The Hegemony]] and their architecture, culture, and people are known for their extravagance and wealth.  The native [[Quori]] live in harmony with the people of the city, despite not living directly inside of it. |

They are cursed by [[The Whispered One]] to rise again when they die, and their city is filled with their living ancestors known as [[Draugr]].  [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] craftsmanship has been able to harness the power of flowing water to create simple machines.  The city has no roads and is built vertically within a cliff face.  [[Gozrah]] has very few windows due to the sunlight sensitivity of the [[Draugr]].  It is the only city of [[The Hegemony]] that is not lead by an [[Aurum]]. |

It is the [[Kuo-Toa]] who live here that are masters of traversing the dangerous [[Moonsea|The Moonsea]], making it impossible to travel safely without a [[Kuo-Toa]].  They form one of the most prosperous and richest merchantile guilds in the region, known as [[The Children Of Murgurgula]].  They safely guard the secret of safely sailing [[The Moonsea]].  Due to this fact, it is the [[Kuo-Toa]] who actually rule in the city; despite an [[Octarch]] ruling formally. |

[[Hassomir The Blue|Hassomir]] is a dictator and keeps the city under martial law.  While foreigners chafe at this, those who live here revere [[Hassomir]] equal to one of [[The Gods]] and see his rules as absolute.  As a result, crime is non existent, as is self expression. |
| [img[images/locations/ruje/sharat-kur-preview.jpg][Sharat'Kur]] &lt;br&gt;[[Sharat'Kur]] |[[Sharat'Kur]] is a city rising hundreds of feet above the ocean built upon rocky spires that soar into the sky.   [[Sharat'Kur]] is a [[Quori]] word meaning &quot;City of a Thousand Spires&quot;, and is the native home to the [[Rock Drake]] who are used to glide between the spires.  The buildings of the city are carved directly out of the spires.  A blue phosphorescent shrimp known as a [[Chakalin]] spawns in the calm clear water under the spires; at night they rise and cause the waters to glow blue such that no torches are needed to light the city.  The remains of a small [[Quori]] tribe live nearby and consistently raid the city, seeking retribution for the misuse of the land.  |

[[Tszanthus]] has been destroyed and rebuilt countless time, and the modern city sits on top of the remains of these former cities.

<pre>Anyone with even a hint of [[Elven|Elf]] blood can't help but feel it stir upon setting foot in the High Forest.  The sheer age and the power of the trees, the depth of their roots, and the wind whispering through their leaves - all these things call to us.

A vast forest in the mist of the North, the High Forest is a reminder of ages past, when thick woods blanketed much of [[Asha]], and [[The Sylvan Empire]] was at its zenith.  This forest has barely known the tread and touch of any feet other than the [[Elves|Elf]], and old growth dominates its flora.  The [[Forana'loloKashira]] cities that are found within are built into the environment as to leave the woods untouched, wild, and natural; but there are ruins here from [[Ages|History]] past.  The bones of [[The Sylvan Empire]] still lie tangled within the forest's roots.

This forest is one of the primary secretive [[Havens]] for the [[Forana'loloKashira]], and few beyond the forest known of life here.  They are protective of their land, and travelers in The High Forest must be wary of [[Elves|Elf]] they meet for they can never be sure of their welcome, and any promises of safe passage might not be honored by the next band of [[Elves|Elf]].

Within the depths of The High Forest is an entire mountain range known as [[The Star Mounts]].  Constant strong winds keep flying creatures from piercing the forest from the mountains.  At a distance, the peaks glitter as if light reflecting from massive crystals dotting their slopes.

[[Teldinath Dagon]] was a cruel and calculating man.  He was once a talented mage, however his magical pursuits soon led him down a dark path.  Dagon delved into the black arts of [[Blood Magic]], learning the names of some of the vilest demons.  Nearly 1000 years ago, Dagon summoned a demon by the name of [[Zezebazum]], the very minion of [[Azarad-Ji]] responsible for [[The Third Desecration]] that vanquished [[The Great Sylvan Empire]] thousands of years before Dagon's birth.  [[Teldinath Dagon]] knew [[Zezebazum]] was powerful, and constructed potent magical wards to contain the demon.

Much to his suprise, he found [[Zezebazum]] to be quite pleasant and cordial.  Unlike the other demons he summoned, [[Zezebazum]] spoke with [[Teldinath Dagon]] at great length, answering all of his questions of ancient history.  [[Zezebazum]] spoke of how [[Azarad-Ji]]'s [[Kiraga]] had failed, and perhaps the right HUMAN could earn [[Azarad-Ji]]'s favor.  [[Zezebazum]] promised [[Teldinath Dagon]] imortality and unrestrained power over the mortal realm, if he were to help free [[Azarad-Ji]] from his prison.  The prison was strong and unyielding, however a demonic beast could be created strong enough to cause a tear in the fabric of the prison, thereby giving [[Azarad-Ji]] a chance to escape.  In return, [[Teldinath Dagon]] and all those who assisted would be granted power and immortality.

[[Teldinath Dagon]] freed [[Zezebazum]] from the magical protections he put in place before the summons, and the two of them began planning [[Azarad-Ji]]'s escape.

They discretely assembled willing followers and servants, as well as powerful mages gifted in the black arts.  During this time, the demon kept a very low profile, not wishing to publicly make his presence known for fear of banishment back to the stars.

[[Teldinath Dagon]] called his newfound cult &quot;The Holy Scourge&quot;, and began the ceremonies for the first phase of the plan he and [[Zezebazum]] masterminded.  Nonessential members of the cult were promised immortality and power, much to the same extent as Dagon.  The truth was that their [[Souls|Soul]] were to be inhabited by [[Dathairä]], and their essence and life energies were to be consumed by the very demon that occupied their body.  The demon would gain access to knowledge and memories of its host, but the host's [[Soul]] would be consumed and destroyed in the process.  Dagon called these creations [[Soulfiends]].

Ten [[Soulfiends]] were created, and they were each given the task of harvesting the essence from [[Mortal Souls|Soul]].  This began what is known as [[The Demon Plague]].  A large pool of this energy was required for the ritual [[Teldinath Dagon]] and [[Zezebazum]] needed to perform to create the monster in which they would unleash upon the wall of [[Azarad-Ji]]'s prison.  The [[Soulfiends]] were set forth upon the world, leaving madness and terror in their wake.  Whole villages were laid to waste by the [[Soulfiends]] brutal theft of life energy.

The work of the [[Soulfiends]] was quick, and was not noticed until they began to harvest the energies of those living in the more populous regions of the realms.  Near what is now known as the [[The Dales]], two powerful mages wrested for control of supremacy.  [[Armondax]] the wizard of Brimstone and [[Mysara]], Lady of the Shadowy Depths felt the grips of the [[Soulfiends]] epidemic.  Each found towns within their circles of control occupied by the brainless husks of the townsfolk who once thrived there.

[[Armondax]] and [[Mysara]] both first suspected each other of the dastardly deeds inflicted upon the hapless townsfolk.  They both sought each other out to destroy each other for attacking harmless villagers.  Locked in a deadly magical battle, they both soon realized that neither of them was responsible.  It was at this moment that they became aware of the much more sinister plot brooding in the background.

They focused their efforts in stopping the [[Soulfiends]], their own thoughts of conquest and land were petty in comparison.  As much as they tried, it was a hard fought battle.  The [[Soulfiends]] were not easy combatants, and were not easy to find.

It was not until they were aided by [[Fazar]] the Wizard Knight, and [[Waywill]] Lifehealer that they had the combined power to stop the [[Soulfiends]].  [[Fazar]] and [[Waywill]] Lifehealer traveled from [[Zylok]] as soon as they heard of the evil magic being unleashed in the [[The Dales]].  [[Fazar]] and his army magically fortified towns not yet infected.  [[Waywill]] Lifehealer and a group of his healers tended to the town with the most casualties.</pre>

The Horologuim is the name of the great clock tower in the city of [[Tszanthus]] on the continent of [[Ruje]].  Built by the [[Artificer]] [[Kazimir Angelus Nikomedes]] in 1228 [[Hassomir]] / 986 [[AAP]].  The tower stands 316 feet tall, and the climb from the ground level to the belfry is 334 steps.  Its base is square, measuring 40 feet on each side.  The dials of the clock are 23 feet in diameter.  All eight cities of [[The Freeholds Of The Hegemony|The Hegemony]] are represented on the tower by engraved statues.

!Grim Origins
[[Kazimir Angelus Nikomedes]] placed The Horologuim in [[The Lower Streap]] as a snub to [[The Aurum]], who assumed it would be placed prominently in [[The Sodenward]].  His response was that he wished to give back to [[The Lower Streap]] for everything it taught him as a child.  A proud building for a proud people.  Upon its construction, [[Kazimir|Kazimir Angelus Nikomedes]] died while placing and calibrating the final conducting rod upon the tip of the tower.

!Complicated Designs
Many of the living members of [[The Guild Of Illuminators]] do not understand the complexity of the Horologuim's design.  It is considered one of the most complicated feats of [[Artifice]] in the known world.  Along with broadcasting the time through bells and chimes, it is capable of predicting [[Highstorms|Highstorm]], and collects power from the [[Highstorms|Highstorm]] as lightning strikes the conducting rods placed careful upon its roof.</pre>

The House Of Black Lanterns moves about [[The Shadowfell]] on two legs that resemble that of a chicken.  It moves about seemingly to the whim of [[Yarol]], the proprietor - and appears where and when it is needed, as though whatever force moves it can sense this necessity.  Not even the inn's employees are certain the means of control [[Yarol]] has over the inn, and it is a frequent topic of discussion in the common room.

The inn offers shelter for travelers, as well as a place to share news and swap dark tales.  Raised centuries ago, the inn's ownership has changed hands so many times no one recalls who built the place or why.  The current proprietor [[Yarol]] claims to have won the place in a wager with the previous owner.  [[Yarol]] became the first person in centuries to take over the place non violently.  Although his claim is technically true, he omits the detail that he has an uncanny talent for twisting fate in his favor.

Standing some three stories tall and fronted by an old bell tower, the windows of this building all face inward towards its courtyard; a single door leads outside.  A second building serves s a stable and barn, accessed through a set of doors.  Spread throughout the yard and swinging on black iron lampposts are the lanterns from which the inn takes its name.  Igniting on their own whenever the sun sets, the lanterns cast an eerie blue light throughout the courtyard.

Inside, a well trained staff sees to the needs of guests.  These folk are amiable to travelers, ready to answer questions about [[The Shadowfell]] and provide basic services.  They hesitate only when questions about how they came to work at the inn, quickly finding excuses to change the subject or disengage.  For the equivalent of 5 silver you can get a room upstairs and a hot meal.

[[Yarol]] himself is a [[Shadar-Kai]], a race of [[Human]] accustomed to living within [[The Shadowfell]].  He has a soft spot for newcomers to the realm, easy to spot from the confusion placed upon their faces.  Whether a lost [[Soul]] or cosmic wanderer, [[Yarol]] temporarily hires them on as staff and sees they are cared for until they can find their way home.  Some decide to stay on permanently.

Key staff members include [[Kravdak]], an [[Orc]] warrior who stumbled into [[The Shadowfell]] decades ago and stayed on as a bouncer, and [[NullaQuimo]] (&quot;little apple&quot; in [[Elvish]]), an [[Elf]] maiden who runs the head of house.

!The Origin
The House Of Black Lanterns was forged (or more appropriately, birthed) by the [[Fey]] [[Hag]] [[Babaroga]] after the fall of [[The Court Of Stars]].  It is powered by the very essence of [[The Shadowfell]] and the [[Beating Heart|The Heart Of VanwaHeru]] of [[VanwaHeru]] that allows the interior of the building to transform into what is required, from cottage home to a bustling inn.  [[The Heart|The Heart Of VanwaHeru]] burns as an enteral flame in the hearth of The House Of Black Lanterns, and forms the consciousness of the building.</pre>

''-The Iron Law''
}}}
The Iron Law is the ancient legal system of [[The Hegemony]] of [[Ruje]].  It is a legal system wrought with corruption and cruelty, structured in a way that pins the lower class into their station while elevating [[The Aurum]].  The Iron Law contains a number of specific offenses directed at curtailing the practice of different forms of [[Magic]], these include &quot;Consortation with Demonic Powers, &quot;Malicious Use of Unnatural Arts&quot;, and &quot;Malfeasance&quot;.  Historically the punishment for circumventing these prohibitions was extremely severe, although modern sensibilities have overcome long lost superstitions and it has been a considerable time since such draconic provisions on [[Magic]] have been enforced.

The Iron Law is structured into three main offenses: Spells, Crueltys, and Transgressions.  If any crime is commited, it can be solved with punishment or a Restitution.  Paying a guard, or the state, or the transgressed could eliminate the crime from the ledgers.  Every crime has a price, even if that price is purposefully absurd.

Some laws have a close connection to the religion of [[The Church Of Final Atonement]], and The Iron Law often quotes their holy book [[The Book Of Atl]].  By quoting the book, the law gives power to [[The Church|The Church Of Final Atonement]], and allows them to bypass many crimes or refuse to pay when they are accused.

Some of the most dark laws are left over from laws imposed during [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]] and [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]].  One of the most notorious involves the [[Draugr]]: &quot;All [[Draugr]] must register with the state as being a slave to its family&quot; and its sister law &quot;upon death, all [[Duergeran]] are hereby adopted by [[The Undying King|The Whispered One]]&quot;.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/baator/stygia/the-kiln-of-the-profaned.jpg]]
The Kiln Of The Profaned is the mechanism by which [[Dathairä]] reform and regrow from grievous injury and even death.  It is a painful process, in which the creature slowly forms into an embryo of blood and flesh, suspended by chains of sinew within a flesh covered room.  The growth process can takes months, and the embryo must be fed a number of [[Souls|Soul]] equivalent to the rank of the [[Dathairä]].

[[Dathairä]] harvest and store a collection of [[Souls|Soul]] for safe keeping, to be used in the event their rebirth.  The number of [[Souls|Soul]] need can be excruciatingly large, and lesser [[Dathairä]] struggle to pay; forcing them into a devolved status, lower in the rank of [[Baator]].  This is not only a social embarrassment, but the [[Dathairä]] loses all power and privileges they might have once held.

While The Kiln Of The Profaned is formally located within the layer of [[Baator]] known as [[Stygia]], and oversaw by [[Belphagor]], those [[Dathairä]] rich and wealthy enough have their own Kiln within their private fortress.  This is not only a matter of convenience, but it can be difficult to trust a rival like [[Belphagor]] for such a transaction as one's rebirth.</pre>

<div title="The Knights Of Deepwater" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202007072341" modified="202408251401" changecount="21">
<pre>The Knights Of Deepwater worship [[The Gods]] of [[Asha]] through service.  They strive to right wrongs, and defend the weak and unprotected.  Their base of operations is within the city walls of [[Deepwater]], close to the seat of power for [[The Divine Order]].  They protect and defend [[The Viridian Empire]].

!Code Of Honor
//Never break your word; Never defile [[The Gods]] or allow them to be defiled; Defend the weak and unprotected; Never raise your hand against a [[Priest]] or [[Knight]]; Never ignore an insult to yourself, the Knights, or anyone weaker than yourself; Take all pains and discomforts stoically and without apparent burden.//

!The Trials
Before becoming a [[Knight]], one must surpass four trials.  These tests harden and mold a person into what we know as a [[Knight]].  Each trial represents [[a God|The Gods]] of [[Asha]] and their teaching.  They are induced through many hours of meditation and physical manipulation of the body.  A master [[Knight]] must guide initiates through this process.
When a trial is successfully completed by an initiate, their spirit is enriched and their [[Soul]] grows stronger.  Often this results in a brief divination with the prospective [[God|The Gods]].  The Knights strongly believe that what is seen and experienced during the trial is for the traveler, and the traveler alone.  No questions are asked as to what was witnessed.  One major rule is to never undertake a trial alone, always the path must be traveled with a companion.

* ''__The Trial Of Qualok__'' is the understanding that there is not an answer to every question.  Even [[Qualok]] does not possess enough years to fully understand the workings of the universe, which plagues him.  This trial should force the [[Knight]] to admit they do not understand, or they do not know.
* ''__The Trial Of Lucian__'' is one of tranquility and harmony.  To traverse this trial, one must attune one’s [[Soul]] to [[The Gods]].  You must not allow your mind to cloud your [[Soul]], purify oneself with [[Lucian’s|Lucian]] wisdom.  This trial should force the [[Knight]] to help an enemy, or someone they hate and despise.
* ''__The Trial Of Kombar__'' is readiness.  Like [[Kombar]], one must prepare for the turmoil that all creatures must face.  A [[Knight]] never sees the end of this path, and continues to train until the day they become one with [[The Gods]].  This trial should test the limits of their battle experience.
* ''__The Trial Of Xander__''  tests the very limits of a [[Knight's|Knight]] training.  This is the most feared and brutal trial.  The pain and anguish caused by this test has broken many of individuals who have fallen from the Knighthood, unable to endure the sacrifice that [[Xander]] suffered.  This path should attempt to fatigue, confuse, and frighten the [[Knight]].

<pre>In [[The Dock Ward]] of the city of [[Zylok]] sits a strange shop that stands out from the others.  It has a deep purple facade, and in its window is a desiccated head of a [[Dathairä]].  A cloud of lavender scented purple smoke trails out of the shop door as one walks inside.  Every wall is painted purple, and every dusty knickknack on the shelves is dyed a deep violet.  The proprietor, a hairless [[Bairn]] who calls himself [[Nehga]] is fond of sitting cross legged on top of the counter smoking a pipe that is responsible for the lavender smoke.  He is hairless and quite old, wearing a plum colored robe.  His cheeks and forehead are decorated with nine painted eyes.

The desiccated [[Dathairä]] head is indeed real.  [[Nehga]] refers to it by name, which is also [[Nehga]] - but he is clear to point out the name is just coincidence.

<pre>&quot;The Lifting&quot; is the name given to the event in 1021 [[AAP]] when the cities of [[Caldoria]] were raised from the bottom of the ocean.  The seven cities of [[Caldoria]] were protected from the crushing depths of the ocean from a magical dome.  This dome served as protection, but was beginning to deteriorate.  In 142 AAP the first breach was discovered.  A small hole that temporarily formed in the dome causing cold seawater to pour forth - it luckily closed on its own accord.  The [[Dragonborn Elders]], in order to calm the population suggested this was natural and no cause for alarm.  This was the prevailing belief for hundreds of years.  In 1001 [[AAP]], one [[Dragonborn]] named [[Xyvs]] began to study the breaches.  His analysis caused him to determine the breaches were increasing in both frequency and magnitude.  [[Xyvs]] calculated this would cause flooding and lead to the extinction of his society.  The [[Dragonborn Elders]] ignored him, thinking him foolish; and the general population continued to believe the breaches to be part of the natural cycle designed by its creators - bringing new air, water and life.

In 1021 [[AAP]] [[The Grey Companions]] on the maiden voyage of [[The Airship Triumph]] inadvertently discovered one of these breaches, when their ship was pulled down into a giant whirlpool.  To many [[Dragonborn]], their very existence proved the surface of [[Asha]] was hospitable and the fallibility of the [[Dragonborn Elders]].

[[Kurga The Black]] was [[The Speaker Of The Council Of Elders|The Council Of Elders]], and had just recently killed the other [[Elders|Dragonborn Elders]] to slowly gain more power and control; the slow rot of [[Desecration]] reaching even under the ocean.

{{quote{
//The greatest weapon in the world is the human mind.  Use it wisely.//
''-Unknown, proverb of The Medica''
}}}
The Medica Of [[Tszanthus]] is an organization found throughout the continent of [[Ruje]], holding a monopoly on [[Human]] immortality through their perfection of a process known as [[The Sacrament]].  [[The Sacrament]] is an invasive medical procedure whose process is closely guarded by The Medica.  It has the ability to extend life indefinitely, causing the subject's skin to acquire a bluish hue after taking a number of treatments.

The power of The Medica is vast, built upon the wealth and influence generated from their monopoly of [[The Sacrament]].  The organization is one of the most powerful in [[Ruje]], with deep ties and influence into the government.  While financially out of reach for the average citizen of [[Ruje]], The Medica is one of the most well respected organizations, as The Medica are perceived as generous in their advancements in health and wellness.

Those with training call themselves [[Physicers|Physicer]], and guard their secrets with fervor.

!The Secret Of Galvanic Rebirth
The Medica's process was made possible through the study that [[Galvandra]] made in [[The Third Age]].  She was a [[Druid]] in the service of [[The Whispered One]] who conducted medical experiments that while unethical was considered the most comprehensive study of the mechanics of the living body.  While her procedures are considered crude and immoral, her groundbreaking analysis is still taught today, making her an honorary first Medica.  Due to her questionable past, these origins are a closely guarded secret that only those in positions of authority within The Medica are privy to.

[[The Sacrament]] is the process which converts the rare but mundane [[Death Scarab]] into what is known as an [[Envoy]].  When embedded into the skin of a mortal creature, has the ability to store a [[Soul]] and either extend life or transfer consciousness between bodies.

!Baldarrain University and The Crockery
In [[Orphillion]] 23 (263 [[IO]]), [[Erasmus Baldarrain]] founded [[Baldarrain University]], which later became the cornerstone and defacto headquarters of The Medica.  Here, modern research into [[The Sacrament]] is performed - perfecting the serum and process.  Later, [[The White Garden Asylum For The Mentally Insane]] (known to the citizens of [[Tszanthus]] simply as [[The Crockery]]) was constructed - an institution dedicated to the rehabilitation and research of those whose minds have been shattered due to exposure of the [[Highstorm]].

!Contributions to society
Throughout the generations, The Medica have performed experiments that pushed the boundaries of science and medicine.  While their practices on the sick, dying and destitute lower class have been morally questionable, they have led to startling breakthroughs in the study of anatomy, [[The Soul|Soul]] and the understanding of health and wellness.

* [[Ereshkigal Delondra]] experimented with the effects of a substance he named [[Ammenox]], which aided in in blood coagulation and wound closure.  Many of his patience were subjected to torturous and painful wounds for him to properly develop his serum.  [[Ammenox]] is commonly available in [[Ruje]] as a healing tablet or serum which can be applied to those who have suffered grievous wounds.</pre>

<pre>The Memoirs Of Hagen Hairfoot is an autobiographical [[book|Books and Literature]] written in 25 [[AAP]] by [[Hagen Hairfoot]], a [[Bairn]] [[Bard]].  He was an adventurer of some renown who lived in the city of [[Zylok]] during the formation of [[The Viridian Empire]]. 

His memoirs are composed across multiple volumes, each containing tall tales that make for exciting reading.  He lived during the [[Azutan Nagyos]] and played a roll alongside the founders of [[The Athenaeum]] and [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].  He was a good friend to [[Waywill]], [[Armondax]], [[Mysara]], and [[Fazar]] - and sang of their greatness and contribution.

Some of his most fanciful tales in the books include [[Mysara]] traveling [[The Planes Of Existence]] through [[The Mirror Of Resplendence]] made of liquefied [[Mana]], [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]] raising [[The Athenaeum]] from dirt using the power of [[Magic]], and tales of [[Hagen Hairfoot]] and how he walked the length of [[The Viridian Empire]] four times over.  His most exciting tale was how he cheated death itself.</pre>

<pre>The Mirror Of Resplendence is a hidden and lost section of [[The Athenaeum]], built by the original founds.  The mirror itself is made from a rippling pool of liquid [[Mana]], and housed within an ornate brass and gold housing of clockwork, with crystal lenses used to focus [[Leyline|Leylines]] energy.

!The Guardian
[[Mysara]] appointed a guardian of the mirror, a [[Beholder]] named [[Tyranthrax]].  He has lived within the proximity of the mirror for over 1,000 years - and like many of his kind is mildly insane and schizophrenic.  [[Tyranthrax]], however, is enthralled by the power of the mirror - and seeks to catalog it's workings and behavior.

!The Trials
Each of the founders placed a trial in front of the mirror, to protect it from intrusion.  Only those strong of [[Magic]] and of will can succeed at the trials.
* ''The Trial Of [[Waywill Lifehealer]]'' - This trial is a room with an 8x8 [[Dragon Chess]] board.  The only way through the room to the door on the other side is to walk across the board.  Once one steps on the board, they are magically compelled through force to move like the piece that corresponds to the square they entered on.  An opposing chess piece on the opposite side of the board makes the same moves.  If their piece is taken, they are removed to the starting side of the room.
* ''The Trial Of [[Fazar]]'' - This room is a grand room of marble, with ornate stone statues of warriors covering every inch of the walls and grand pillars.  A large set of locked double doors are the only exit.  The doors cannot be magically unlocked, and every casting of a spell brings one statue to life to attack the intruder.
* ''The Trial Of [[Armondax]]'' - After descending stairs and passing through a set of metal doors there is a small nondescript room of smooth grey stone.  The walls are slightly blackened at the base.  Upon entering the room, the doors close behind and flames engulf the walls and floor.  There is a sound of grinding stone and a small opening only a few inches in diameter is seen in the flames.  If one reaches their hand inside, there is a lever to shut off the flames and reveal another set of stairs downward.
* ''The Trial Of [[Mysara]]'' - The final and most brutal of tests.  The room appears as a natural cavern that snakes in a serpentine pattern.  The walls have large sections of rough mirror shared embedded within them, creating hundreds of reflected images.  A heavy set of doors bars the way.  Observant individuals will notice there is no torches within the room, despite there being light.  Instead, the torch is seen in one of the mirrors, hanging next to the exit door in the mirror version of the room.  Touching a mirror causes the person's mirror version of themselves to pull them through the mirror to fight.  Removing the torch and placing it in the real world holder will open the door.</pre>

<pre>The Moonsea is the name of the expanse of water that sits between the mainland of [[Ruje]] and [[The Freeholds Of The Hegemony|The Hegemony]] that perch upon [[The Crescent Archipelago]].  The Moonsea region is as vibrant and diverse as it is dangerous.  The waters of The Moonsea are treacherous and equally as savage as [[Ruje's|Ruje]] infamous jungles.  Both the jungles and the sea are teaming with ferocious beasts, [[fierce storms|Highstorm]], and legendary monsters.  It is due to these facts that [[Ruje]] is regarded as one of the most dangerous and untamed places in all of [[Asha]].

!The Menagerie Coast
The coast of The Moonsea is known as [[The Menagerie Coast]].  It is home to [[The Freeholds Of The Hegemony|The Hegemony]], cities who have carved an existence out of the savage land.  The Moonsea is a harsh mistress, and only [[the fish-folk|Kuo-Toa]] known as the [[Kuo-Toa]] have the skill to navigate it safely.  They hold this monopoly with an iron fin, and no ships safely sail The Moonsea without a [[Kuo-Toan Wind Finder]] at the helm.  [[The Moonsea]] remains a mystery to outsiders, with only the bravest or most foolhardy of sailors being able to make the harsh journey to the northern tip of [[The Crescent|The Crescent Archipelago]]; the city of [[Akar]].</pre>

<pre>The Mummers are led by whomever bears the title of [[The Salt King]].  [[The Salt King]] rules from The Mummer's stronghold of [[Grimstone]], located within [[The Risen Reef]] off of the eastern coast of [[Amon]].  As the de facto ruler of The Mummers, [[The Salt King]] commands the numerous pirates and ships - seeing that their basic system of law and order is maintained.  In the event of a major dispute between two or more Mummers pertaining to the breaking of the law, their case is brought before [[The Salt King]] at which point the parties argue their cases and [[The Salt King]] makes judgement accordingly.  If one party is found to be at fault, depending on the severity of the offense, the offending party may be sentenced to pay some form of restitution to the offending party or may even be put to death if [[The Salt King]] deems it suitable.

!The Code Of The Mummers
* ''The Code Of Civility'' - no Mummer shall strike another aboard their ship or upon the soil of [[Grimstone]]; every dispute is settled by duel on the command of the quartermaster.  He who draws first blood shall be declared the victor.
* ''The Rite Of Parlay'' - when invoking this right, one has temporary protection from harm until granted an audience with the enemy captain.  Parley is not considered concluded until said captive and captain have completed negotiations.
* ''The Honor of the Escudo'' - the [[Escudo]] is a steel coin minted by The Mummers.  It is less of a form of currency and more of a form of respect, the currency of relationships.
* ''The Don't Hunt Our Own'' - The Mummers don't steal from one another.  Knowingly targeting other pirate ships is forbidden.  Respect your fellows in all accounts.
* ''Mercy To Those Who Ask'' - killing a surrendered enemy is not allowed.  The mercy of The Mummers shall not be overlooked.
* ''No Games Of Chance'' - no Mummer shall game for money; either with dice or cards
* ''Sharing of the spoils'' - all crew of a vessel share equally in the plunder.  The captain and first mate are entitled to double share, and one share is kept for [[The Salt King]].  Whomever spotted the ship/plunder gets first pick.

The Northlands is mountainous and rugged, like it's people. It was the final region of [[The Viridian Empire]] to be added, through conquest of the [[Kells|Kell]].  Ruled by [[House Karbold]], who descend from the [[Kellish|Kell]] people who once inhabited the land.

!Notable Locations
* [[Kohor]] - the capital of The North, which still contains a great forge from [[The First Men]], ancestral home of [[House Karbold]]
* [[Westgate]] is a small military outpost built on the civilized side of the [[The Westron Wall]].  It functions mainly as a deposit for the family members of the militia defending the wall.
* [[Vargë]] is a small village that represents the most northern territory of [[The Viridian Empire]].  While there are those that live beyond, they are not touched by [[The Empire|The Viridian Empire]]
* [[The Reach]] is the name of the most northern region of [[The Northlands]].  The small villages and towns here offer refuge and civilization, whereas the land outside the walls are full of untamed dangers.

!Adventure Hooks
''Something Wicked This Way Comes'' - Something is forcing the [[Jötnar]] of the mountains to migrate southward.  The party is hired by the local [[Reeve]] to eliminate these unwelcome brutes, offering gold for each [[Jötnar]] ear delivered.

Those that follow the accumulated spiritual and mythological beliefs of the [[Kellish|Kell]] warrior culture call themselves [[The Oathsworn]] or [[The Chosen]].  Like the [[Kell]] themselves, their religion saw numerous changes throughout the course of history, with its origins being made during the tumultuous time of [[The Second Age]], when a small number of [[The First Men]] were all that remained of [[Humanity|Human]].  The religion has no central authority figure, however core beliefs, principles, and practices are kept by shamanistic religious figures known as [[The Oathsworn]].

!Zealots At The Core: The Chosen
{{quote{
//The Oath shall be kept by blood, sword, and axe.//
}}}
The Oathsworn followers are intensely devout in their beliefs, forming a deeply religious society.  Some within the group grew more militant and aggressive in response to issues of [[Kellish|Kell]] cultural identity waning in favor of what was seen as the declining morality brought by the influences of [[The Viridian Empire]].  They named themselves [[The Chosen]].  These zealots are an aggressive political force, with an astute graps of insurgency warfare.  They desire [[Kellish|Kell]] independence.  Due to most [[Kells|Kell]] having a connection to the oath, these zealots find helpful agents and sympathizers living among the populace.  While not all [[Kells|Kell]] agree with their tactics, many long for a return to the old ways.  [[The Chosen]] are primarily composed of [[Kells|Kell]] native to [[The Northlands]] of [[Kellos]].

!Foundations Of The Faith
{{quote{
//Blood; the blood of [[The First Men]] grants me Strength.//
//Strength; with Strength I protect my Life.//
//Life; Life preserves my Fate.//
//and may my Fate bring me Glory.//
//''-The Oath''//
}}}
The origin of The Oath solidified during [[The Second Age]] among [[The First Men]] of [[Asha]], who struggled to survive during [[The Cataclysm]].  The descendants of [[The First Men]] found themselves clinging to survive in a sundered planet filled with horrors and dangers never seen before.  With [[The Human Race|Human]] on the verge of extinction, The Oath bonded what would become [[The Kell|Kell]] by blood, sword and axe.  It hardened them in order to prepare them for the hard path of survival they had before them.
Every day brings challenge to the [[Kell]]. For the tribes of [[The Far North Of Kellos|The Reach]], food, water, and shelter are rare in their mountainous homes - a single mistake can bring down an entire tribe, while an individual's heroic effort can ensure the entire group's survival. The Kell take pride in individualistic skill and self-sufficiency. They love to win, but see defeat as a prod to improve themselves.

<div title="The Obsidian Path" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202109140011" modified="202112131759" changecount="6">
<pre>The Obsidian Path is a distinct form of beliefs found within the [[Religion]] known as [[The Way]].  Practitioners follow strict ideological practices that differ from the other three paths.  They believe that the universe if full of [[Magic]], mystery, and [[Occult]]; all things to be used for the betterment of the living.  Powerful entities inhabit this universe, and those who follow The Obsidian Path beseech these entities for favors and gifts.  They have no taboo against what some of other cultures may call dark or evil; and weigh a calculated analysis of the benefit vs cost.

!Ethics and Morals
While outsiders may see The Obsidian Path as toying with dangerous powers outside of their control, in practice they are calculated in their endeavors to ensure the benefit outweighs the cost.  They believe that life is sacred, both at the beginning and the end of life.  They are not malicious nor frivolous with their incantations, and follow a strict code of ethics when taking life to power their [[Magic]].
* sacrifices of sentient beings should be given willingly
* don't allow ritual sacrifices to feel deliberate pain and suffering, give the entity no satisfaction
* give the entity as little as possible, you aren't worshiping it, you are using it
* be thankful and grateful for the sacrifice, honor them
* don't let creatures die in vain, death should mean something.

!Sacrifices
Ritualistic [[Human]] sacrifice may be done voluntarily for the betterment of the community.  For example, it is an honor to sacrifice oneself to end a plague, drought, or famine.  It is customary for the life of the sacrifice to be taken by a loved one, someone very close to the individual.  This is a great honor, and there is much beauty in this ceremony.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/organizations/the-oeridian-kingdoms.jpg]]
The Oeridian Kingdoms are one of the oldest known nations of [[Human]] civilization, dating back to the early [[The Third Age]] of [[Asha]] in 6175 [[IO]].  It's territory covered parts of modern day [[Amon]] and [[Ruje]].  The kingdoms were ruled by a lose collection of warlords, all taking a serpent as their emblem - depicting a fanged two headed snake.  Chief among the warlords was [[Harmost Xawn]], a fierce warrior and cunning general.

Their architecture favored massive brick towers and pyramids built using slave labor.  Since the hills of the region were rich in copper, they favored bronze weapons.  The kingdoms were warlike and began subjugating its neighbors.

The kingdoms were replaced with [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]] through a series of conflicts around 3199 [[IO]]

One of the greatest cities of The Oeridian Kingdoms was [[Nyanzaru]], and the first [[Human]] city of [[The Third Age]] was [[Kararindi]].</pre>

<div title="The Old Faith" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202301082325" modified="202304142216" tags="religion" changecount="22">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/gods/the-eternal-cycle.jpg]]

The Old Faith is a [[Religion]] and naturalistic philosophy first popularized by the [[Elves|Elf]] of [[The Third Age]].  They revered nature and the natural order above all; seeking a mythic spirituality of transcendent union with nature.  The Old Faith believes that plants and animals all share a [[Soul]] that originates from [[Valouria]] herself, known simply as [[The Mother|Valouria]].  As all life sprang forth from her tomb, all life must also return in [[The Eternal Cycle]].

Followers of The Old Faith meditate daily, commune with nature, and show respect in the nature of all things.  They often hang fresh herbs from the lintels of doorways to honor [[The Mother|Valouria]].  Although The Old Faith is based on nature, one need not be a [[Druid]] to value its tenets, nor do all [[Druids|Druid]] necessarily count themselves as members of this philosophy, although almost all of them appreciate its values.

!History
The Old Faith dates back to [[Elvendawn]], when [[Lucian]] first breathed life into the [[Elves|Elf]].  Even in the earliest forms of its existence, the faith venerated three things: the endurance of the spirit, the power and ferocity of the wild beasts, and the bountiful nature and the purity of the elements.

!Belief and Dogma
The Old Faith reveres nature and the natural order above all.  Its tenets all seek a union with nature rather than a devotion to a [[Divine|Divine Magic]] entity or religious construct.  Practitioners believe that these ancient traditions are woven into the fabric of life itself, and are what make up The Old Faith.  In contrast to the worship of [[Gods|The Gods]] in temples and shrines, The Old Faith is not written in tomes and texts, but felt within the wind and seen in the stars.  It is possible to observe and take note of natural phenomena - such as the type and kind of flocking birds or the pattern formed by dropping a stone into a still pond.
The Old Faith subscribes that the universe is alive, having movement and the ability to act.  All within are connected with a great web of life, their [[Souls|Soul]] originating from [[Valouria]] and part of the same whole.  Practitioners understand that the universe was not created by [[The Gods]], and instead is another natural entity into itself.  The dogma of The Old Faith seeks to explore and uncover the truths present within the natural universe.  It seeks to understand these truths, internalize them, and preserve them. These truths are:
* ''The First Truth: The Eternal Cycle'': The first truth and central belief of The Old Faith is that of [[The Eternal Cycle]].  The never ending circle of life: spring blooms into summer, which fades into autumn and then descends into winter before winter gives rise to spring.  The moon waxes, wanes, and waxes again.  Life gives way to death, which leads to rebirth.  The root of the philosophy of The Old Faith is grounded in the belief that [[The Eternal Cycle]] continues without end, an unstoppable force of paradoxical creation and destruction.
* ''The Second Truth: Karma'': When life is born an dies, the spirit endures.  An individual nature spirit will undergo endless transitions of multiple lives throughout time; bodies of the land, water, sky, fire, and vegetable bodies.  Spirits begin in a primordial state and evolve or regress based upon their [[Karma]].  [[Karma]] is accrued with the actions a spirit makes, words they say, and the thoughts they think.  This [[Karma]] attaches to the spirit.  Violence, lies, theft, and selfish thoughts all infiltrate the [[Soul]] and hamper its growth and potential for the next rebirth.  Violence negatively effects and destroys ones [[Soul]], particularly when the violence is done with intent, hate, pleasure, carelessness, or when one indirectly causes or consents to the killing of a living being.
* ''The Third Truth: Forces Of Nature'': The seven forces that make up nature - Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Dusk, Dawn, and Starts - are The Third Truth.  These forces are made manifest as [[Archfey]]; entities who are physical personifications of their domain.  The [[Archfey]] are awakened sentient spirits, intertwined incarnations of the natural force they represent.  The Old Faith holds no significance in these [[Archfey]], other than understanding that they are slaves to their nature.
* ''The Fourth Truth: Balance'':  For [[The Eternal Cycle]] to turn, all things must remain and exist in balance.  There is a place or everything natural somewhere in the universe.  Death exists because it must, and winter comes because it is part of [[the cycle|The Eternal Cycle]].  nature is wild and dangerous, and the predator is just as much a part of the world as the prey.  The Old Faith constantly strives to maintain the balance of nature through their actions and in their thoughts.  Even the seven forces of nature must remain in equilibrium for the universe to exist.

The Old Faith believes that plants and animals all share a soul that originates from [[Valouria]] herself, known simply as [[The Mother|Valouria]].  Those that practice The Old Faith do not worship her per se, but seek to preserve her gift of life.  As all life on [[Asha]] sprang from her tomb, all life must also return in [[The Eternal Cycle]].  Those who are most devout can attune themselves to this spiritual energy and are called [[Druids|Druid]].

There exist traditions and places of pilgrimage in The Old Faith, places of power and majestic beauty based in the natural world that hold great significance.  To the casual observer, there is nothing special to mark these locations, but they are instantly recognizable to one of the faith.  While all of [[Asha]] is considered sacred to The Old Faith, these special places emanate mystical [[Primal Magic]] and act as portals to other [[Planes Of Existence|The Planes Of Existence]] across [[The Echo Planes]] and [[The Fountains Of Creation]].  At these nexus points, it is a convergence of the [[Leylines]] of [[Asha]] that generate the [[Primal Magic]].

!Holidays
The worshipers of The Old Faith do not need calendars, which are just constructs of civilization.  The markers they use are the changing of seasons and natural phenomenon.  As a result, The Old Faith mainly celebrates, with simple rituals, the equinoxes and solstices.

<div title="The Old Republic" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="201507121647" modified="202211221802" changecount="25">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/organizations/the-old-republic.jpg]]
The Old Republic (1775 [[IO]] - 1 [[AAP]]) was the nearly 2,000 year long period of [[Kellos]] beginning with the deposing of [[Tarmon Gellius II]], known as &quot;The Frail King&quot; of [[Kellos]] in 1775 [[IO]] and ending with [[Cyril Viridian]] declaring himself [[Emperor]] in 1 [[AAP]].  The Republic was replaced with [[The Viridian Empire]], one of the most powerful governments on [[Asha]] to date.

!The Autonomy Of The Regions
During the reign of [[Tarmon Gellius II]], the politics of [[Kellos]] was fragmented into rival regions and pressured by [[The Kellish Wars]].  The establishment of the republic separated the power of the king; allowing the individual regions more autonomy.  At its beginning, there were eleven regions each governed by a [[Regent]].  This expanded to a total of 38 regions at the extent of the Republic.  The city of [[Bandor]] and its surrounding territories were considered a region to be controlled by the Senate.  It was the home of the Senate, and considered the be owned by all of the people of The Republic.

!The Senate
The creation of The Republic saw that each of the regions would have the necessary autonomy to govern themselves; and a senate established to settle grievances and assemble armies under a single banner if The Republic ever found cause to brace itself for war.  In the early days the senate was politically weak, and a place for petty squabbles.  Towards the end of the republic, the senate had reached the apex of its political might - and possessed more power than the individual regions combined.  The position of [[Consul]] was an elected position (by the Senate) to rule over the senate for a term of 2 years.  This role continued to expand (as did its term limits) as the Republic grew.

!Rules, Laws and Culture
The Republic resurfaced many traditions from the original [[Amoni Empire|The Amoni Empire]], including slavery, and gladiatorial combat for death sentences.

!Positions In The Old Republic
__''[[Praetor]]''__ - A [[Praetor]] was only chosen when armies were needed; they had full command of military matters
__''[[Regent]]''__ - The [[Regent]] had control over a specified region of The Republic
__''[[Consul]]''__ - The [[Consul]] ruled over the senate, breaking ties and issuing mandates
__''[[Censor]]''__ - The role of [[Censor]] oversaw a region's census, morality, finances, and tax collection
__''[[Magistrate]]''__ - The [[Magistrate]] oversaw the operations of a city or town
__''[[Questor]]''__ - The [[Questor]] assisted the [[Magistrate]] with financial duties
__''[[Aedile]]''__ - The [[Aedile]] assisted the [[Magistrate]] with overseeing of buildings and festivals
__''[[Prefect]]''__ - The [[Prefect]] assisted the [[Magistrate]] with police and safety</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/kellish-language.jpg]]
The Old Tongue is a language that was spoken by [[The First Men]] of [[Kellos]], known as [[Kells|Kell]].  Fragments remain in common use among those living in [[The Northlands]] of [[The Viridian Empire]], and it is in full use among the [[northern barbarian tribes|Kell]] that still practice the nomadic culture of their ancestors.  The Old Tongue has no written form, all histories and lineage’s of the [[Kell]] are passed through oral traditions.

[[Kells|Kell]] are very patriotic, and prize their language and beliefs.  Therefore even [[Kells|Kell]] born outside of the northern plains learn to speak Kellish at an early age.

!Guide To Pronunciation
Pronounce U “oo” as in boot, A “ah” as in father, I “ee” as in marine.  The letters Q and X do not exist in the Kellish language. Consonants mirror their English equivalents, with the exception of GY.  GY is pronounced “dee” as in medium.

Due to the practical lifestyle the [[Kells|Kell]] are forced to live on the harsh [[northern plains|NorthernPlains]], their language is also practical.  Nouns and Verbs for luxurious or items not directly related to survival or warfare often do not exist in the Kellish language.

!Common Sayings and Phrases
Halal so kovet – “our fates converge” used as a greeting
Ritus borozag – Rite of passage: receiving the clan naming
Tronra lepes – the ceremony for becoming chief of a clan
Halal dicsaret – may your fate be kind – used to say ‘goodbye’

<div title="The Ordning" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202111250147" modified="202307171318" tags="religion" changecount="14">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/organizations/the-ordning.jpg]]
The Ordning is as much a religion to the [[Jötnar]] as it is a social construct.  All [[Jötnar]] have a strong internal sense that allows them to understand their position in the social hierarchy that is The Ordning.  They subscribe to the concepts of [[Maat]] and [[Maug]] in which some actions increase ones standing in The Ordning ([[Maat]]) and others reduce it ([[Maug]]).  In 1026 [[AAP]], after the effects of [[The Apotheosis]], the race of the [[Bairn]] were included in The Ordning with the introduction of [[The Ordning Of Leisure]].

!The Hierarchy Of The Ordning
Progressing through The Ordning requires constant attenuation to societal needs and pressures.  Just as The Ordning is a means of hierarchical social structure among the [[Jötnar]], The Ordning itself has a hierarchy and tier to how one approaches increasing their social standing.  Wisdom is valued more than Wealth, which is valued more than Craft, which is valued more than Might, which is valued more than Stamina.  It is ones collective score of [[Maat]] and [[Maug]] across these dimensions that determine status among the community.  There are strict practices one must observe, where you may not progress in a higher tiered ordning without first maximizing the lower tiers.  There are some [[Jötuun|Jötnar]] who fail to progress beyond a particular tier, and that is the way of things.

| [[The Ordning Of Wisdom]] · [[The Ordning Of Wealth]] · [[The Ordning Of Craft]] · [[The Ordning Of Might]] · [[The Ordning Of Stamina]] · [[The Ordning Of Leisure]] |

!The Thrym
[[The Thrym]] (pronounced &quot;thrim&quot;) are those with [[Jötnar]] blood that can't feel The Ordning.  This is rare for a full-blooded [[Jötuun|Jötnar]], and more common for half-breeds and giant-kin like the [[Goliath]].

!Children
[[Jötnar]] adolescent children do not participate in The Ordning until they come of age.  Only great and significant deeds may be carried forward into The Ordning.  While many [[Jötnar]] youth adhere to traditional [[Jötuun|Jötnar]] behavior, others experiment with more &quot;[[maug-like|Maug]]&quot; activities that would otherwise threaten their position in The Ordning.  A rare few use their adolescence as a time to prepare for The Ordning, causing them to more quickly progress through the hierarchy when their time approaches.

!The Lowest Of The Jötnar
The lowest of the [[Jötnar]] are not looked down upon or disgraced.  The Ordning requires a hierarchy, and there will always be those at the top and those at the bottom.  [[The Miskuun]] is the name of the practice where those higher in The Ordning train, tutor and mentor those lower of standing.  It is understood that a rising tide raises all boats, and a desire by most [[Jötnar]] to increase the bar of The Ordning year over year.  This practice was enacted by [[King Hridnir]], who wished a future where the lowest ranked [[Jötuun|Jötnar]] had a higher score than he had when creating [[The Miskuun]].

!The Broken Ordning
In the events leading up to [[The Apotheosis]] in 1026 [[AAP]], The Ordning was shattered.  [[Jötnar]] were unable to feel their position in The Ordning, creating chaos and confusion.  Mysteriously, after the elevation of the [[Aptheons|Apotheon]], The Ordning was restored with a new addition:  The [[Bairn]] of [[The Northlands]] of [[Kellos]] were inducted into The Ordning in a new tier known as [[The Ordning Of Leisure]], cementing a kinship between the two [[Races|Race]].  The [[Bairn]] tend to live life without much care or thought to The Ordning, which has the strange effect of granting them [[Maat]] within [[The Ordning Of Leisure]].</pre>

<pre>!The Echo Planes
[[The Echo Planes]] are comprised of [[The Material Plane]], [[The Feywild]], [[The Shadowfell]], and [[Sene'Rine'Rada]].  They were created when [[The Elysians|Elysian]] created the tomb of [[Valouria]].  Each in turn house her body, heart, mind and spirit.  Every 500 years, the barriers between [[The Echo Planes]] grow thin in a process known as the [[Conjunction|The Conjunction Of The Echo Planes]].

It is one of the four [[Echo Planes|The Echo Planes]], made up by the tomb of [[Valouria]]. This plane is also known as &quot;The Mortal World&quot; as it is home to the mortal [[Races]] of [[Asha]].  At the end of [[The Second Age]], the [[Elysians|Elysian]] erected [[The Divine Gate]] to protect [[The Material Plane]] and the other inner planes from the influences of [[The Void]] and [[The Abyss]]. |

Underneath it's beautiful exterior, this place hides an unexpected danger.  Passion is infused across the realm, even in the [[Archfey's|Archfey]] mortal enemy, the [[Fomorian]].|

It is a dark dimension of desolate rocky wasteland, covered in shadows.  What lives here is a twisted personification of [[Valouria's|Valouria]] torment and anguish.  What fragments of her mind remain are at the core of this place, restless with fits of semi-consciousness; a shadow of her former self.  The realm is ruled by three echos of [[Valouria]] known as [[The Raven Queen]].|

The world is malleable, one can project thoughts and create fantastical creatures and buildings. |

!The Inner Planes
[[The Inner Planes]] were creations of the [[Elysians|Elysian]].  Everything within [[The Inner Planes]] was once their domain.  The term &quot;inner&quot; refers to being inside of the pocket that was the extent of [[Umwe's|Umwe]] domain.
| [img[images/locations/baator/dis/dis-icon.jpg][Baator]] &lt;br&gt;[[Baator]] |[[Baator]] is home to the [[Dathairä]]; once the domain of [[Azarad-Ji]] himself.  It is a plane aligned to cruelty, where [[Mortal Souls|Soul]] that have lived a more evil life migrate in the afterlife.  Baator is organized into nine regions, often called &quot;The Nine Hells&quot;.  Each of these regions have their own physical laws and properties that mirror the malevolent characteristics of its ruler. |

Few know of its existence, and only [[Gafflinz]] live here.  It is a [[Mana]] dead zone, completely dark, with gravity being fickle and objective; paths and platforms built haphazardly by the [[Gafflinz]] dot the landscape. |
| [img[images/locations/arborea/arborea-icon.jpg][Arborea]] &lt;br&gt;[[Arborea]] |[[Arborea]] was once a plane of desolation known as [[Limbo]], with relics and ruins from the endless fighting of [[The Eternal Conflict]].  It sat abandoned and dead as both the [[Elysian]] and [[Dathairä]] once had footholds on this plane, until their fighting destroyed the very need to control the plane at all.  When the [[Apotheon]] [[ElethaNori]] first lay eyes upon [[Limbo]] her heart was saddened and she gifted a seed of life which caused the plane to grow with verdant beauty.  She named the place [[Arborea]]. |

!The Boundary Planes
[[The Boundary Planes]] hold [[The Planes Of Existence]] together.  It was [[The Astral Stream]] that [[Umwe]] created first to begin storing his growing power.  Inside of it he placed the inner planes.  After [[Valouria's|Valouria]] death, the [[Elysians|Elysian]] formed [[The Echo Planes]] at the center of [[The Planes Of Existence]] and placed [[The Fountains Of Creation]] around it in order to secure it in this place of prominence.

This plane is the source of [[Magic]], created by [[Umwe]] as the infinite manifestation of his power.  It protects the other realms from the unknown horrors that lay beyond in [[The Outer Planes]].  It is here the [[Elysians|Elysian]] erected [[The Divine Gate]] to permanently seal and preserve the life within. |
| [img[images/locations/the-fountains-of-creation/the-fountains-of-creation-icon.jpg][The Fountains Of Creation]] &lt;br&gt;[[The Fountains Of Creation]] |[[The Fountains Of Creation]] are a collection of planes of elemental chaos that hold and secure [[The Echo Planes]].  The number of planes within [[The Fountains Of Creation]] are vast, with the four primary being [[The Elemental Plane Of Water]], [[Air|The Elemental Plane Of Air]], [[Fire|The Elemental Plane Of Fire]], and [[Earth|The Elemental Plane Of Earth]].  Each of these planes dynamically interact with each other creating ephemeral sub planes that are both born and die.  These are the realms where the [[Primordial]] [[Titans|Titan]] were born of raw elemental power. |

!The Outer Planes
[[The Outer Planes]] exist outside of [[Umwe's|Umwe]] creation, outside of [[The Divine Gate]].  This space lays outside of the rest of creation, with unknown horrors and aberrations.

<pre>The Purple Masks are a guild of thieves that operate in the city of [[Brand]].  They are currently lead by [[Vaerana]], a no nonsense tough as nails woman who is greatly respected by the criminal underbelly of the city.  The guild specializes in the black market, pickpocket operations and cat burglar activities, leaving behind a purple mask that they affix to the wall with a bodkin.

Due to [[Brand]] being a major trading hub, the Masks specialize in moving black market and contraband goods throughout the realms.  [[Riszan Erodi]] is the proprietor of [[The Vault]], a shop of relics, antiques, and curios.  While he is a businessman and not a formal member of The Purple Masks, he is one of their most notable fences due to his many contacts in and out of [[Brand]].

The Masks work hard to remain discrete.  Random theft is not their style, as it would enrage [[Lord Jakus Saxon|Jakus Saxon]].  In fact, [[Vaerana]] sees that petty theft is kept to a minimum - forcing upstart criminals to join the Masks or leave her city.  Instead, The Masks prey on those who themselves are involved in underhanded schemes.  Anyone moving illegal cargo through [[Brand]] without involving The Purple Masks will soon find themselves missing their cargo.</pre>

<pre>The Quicksilver Program is a breeding program developed by [[SenaCethu]] to create a [[Feytouched]] child that he could love and adopt with the intention of it usurping him and ruling [[The Feywild]].   For more than 10,000 years he directed his legion of [[Hags|Hag]] to cultivate genetic stock from mortal beings, manipulating bloodlines with [[Blood Magic]] to produce a perfect heir.

!A Weapon To Defeat A Prophecy
[[SenaCethu]] began this program in response to a prophecy that he would one day be replaced as the leader of [[The Court Of Stars]].  Someone more powerful, more cunning, and more devious than him.  An [[Archfey]] not of [[The Feywild]].

!A Successful Program
The breeding program was successful, and produced [[Naurase]].  She possessed the ability to manipulate [[The Echo Planes]], and was not bound by the laws of [[The Feywild]].  A perfect cross between mortal and [[Fey]].

!An Unstable Program
After their banishment from [[The Feywild]], many [[Hags|Hag]] continued a form of The Quicksilver Program, despite being unable to recall its original function.  They use their power and [[Magic]] to manipulate both mortal and immortal bloodlines to create an [[Archfey]] capable of leading them once again into their rightful place in [[The Feywild]].

The Raven Queen is the title given to three powerful beings who rule over [[The Shadowfell]] and have attained power there that is [[godlike|The Gods]].  They are a trinity of three distinct aspects united into a single being: [[The Maiden]], [[The Widow]], and [[The Crone]].  They are direct personifications of [[Valouria's|Valouria]] torment and anguish.  What fragments are left of her mind are inside of The Raven Queen.  They are meticulous and protective of one another, as they see themselves as a collective whole.

!The Rule Of Three
Upon reaching an unspecified age, each aspect will ascend to the next position with the eldest being reborn as [[The Maiden]].  They are born anew, free from the memory and torment that they had collected within their existence.  The cycle begins when [[The Widow]] shows signs of pregnancy, growing inside her womb will be the new [[Maiden|The Maiden]].  It is tradition for [[The Crone]] to deliver the baby, planting a single kiss upon its forehead which transfers her life energy as she turns to ash.  The aspects shift with the newborn becoming the new [[Maiden|The Maiden]], with the previous [[Maiden|The Maiden]] rising to the rank of [[The Widow]] and given the duty to raise the child and be the first among equals in ruling [[The Shadowfell]].  The new [[Crone|The Crone]] takes on a role of advisor and mentor, unlocking new capacity for wisdom and knowledge.  The baby grows quickly, and while born free from anguish and pain, they are born fully aware.
One of the standard protocols held by the trinity of The Raven Queen is that [[The Widow]] is never allowed to leave [[The Shadowfell]].  The rare instances of situations that require their attention outside of the domain are handled by [[The Maiden]] or [[The Crone]].

!The Three Aspects

<pre>[&gt;img[images/gods/the-remnant.jpg]]
In a time long past and forgotten within [[The Third Age]], a powerful [[Mage|Magic]] known as [[The Whispered One]] attempted to ascend to godhood by conducting [[The Ritual Of Seeding]].  While born as a mortal [[Human]] of an untouchable caste in what is now modern day [[Amon]], he obtained a mastery of [[Blood Magic]] unlike any mortal had seen before.  His power grew, amassing a [[terrible empire|The Vaecnan Dynasty]] that he ruled over for 1,000 years.  His armies laid siege to the surrounding countryside and he was known as [[The Whispered One]], slaughtering the [[Draugaira Elves|Draugaira]] native to the continent.  He stacked their heads as trophies, as he slaughtered them for his magical experiments.  His lust for power knew no bounds, and he sought to gain the power of a [[god|The Gods]].  [[The Whispered One]] surrounded himself with a cult of fanatical worshipers to protect him during his ritual, yet his apotheosis was shattered by those who wanted to bring his evil to an end.  With The Whispered One destroyed, his followers seemingly vanished from the world.

In anticipation of the ritual's possible failure, [[The Whispered One]] left instructions with his most devoted, allowing for the possibility of his rebirth.  The remains of the cult dubbed themselves The Remnant and began laying the groundwork for The Whispered One's eventual return.  With each passing generation, his will grows ever stronger.  Their symbol is that of a lidless eye on the palm of a skeletal hand.

!Goals
Following the instructions he left behind, The Remnant seeks to slowly infiltrate and indoctrinate elements of society to prepare for the next state in [[The Whispered One's|The Whispered One]] plot.  Each separate sect of the cult is named as a part of his body, and acts independently  to pursue their assigned tasks.  These sub-factions are called The Eyes, The Voice, The Blood, The Hand, and The Heart.  Each splinter cult is tasked with infiltrating and corrupting a respective societal core, and it's said that when the time for their dark master's return is nigh, they shall rejoin as one for the ritual.

The members of The Remnant are largely unknown, and wish to remain so.  Those who are aware of their presence are either members, or have uncovered their insidious existence and seek to stamp it out whenever it may appear.  Thus, there are rarely any alliances made by or with the Remnant.

<pre>The Ritual Of Seeding is a hidden and rare [[Blood Magic]] ritual that allows a mortal the capability to reach [[godhood|The Gods]].  The ritual is difficult to perform, requiring a significant level of [[Magic]] and power.  It is assumed that [[Ammenon]] was the first to uncover the secrets of this ritual, which were ascribed in his personal notes; the tome is known today as [[The Black Rites]].

!Execution
This is a highly complex ritual, requiring the user to be able to perform 9th level [[Magic]], have crafted 6 separate specially prepared [[Trammels|Trammel]] made of pure [[Residuum]], have a deep understanding of [[The Celestial Language|Celestial]], and be at least 20th level or above.

At least 6 other casters must channel 7th level or higher magic into the [[Trammels|Trammel]], sending them into their active state.  During this period, the casters must begin to channel both [[Arcane]] and [[Occult]] energies into the [[Trammel]] that is fed to [[The Ascendant]], who must be at the center of the ritual.

[[The Ascendant]] must make their claim in [[Celestial]], naming their [[True Name]] and what they represent, declaring their position to all in attendance and all listening.  The [[Trammels|Trammel]] will flair up at this point, consuming [[The Ascendant]].

This ritual must be performed on the 20th of [[Nightal]], [[The Winter Solstice]], the longest day of the year.  The material components are six crystals worth 50,000 gold pieces each: Diamond, Ruby, Emerald, Sapphire, Onyx, and Amethyst.

!Known Uses
[[Ammenon]], [[The Whispered One]] attempted this ritual twice.  His last attempt was in 1025 [[AAP]], where he was thwarted when [[Ulan Nailo]] completed [[The Rite Of Prime Banishment]] in order to block [[Ammenon's|Ammenon]] apotheosis while his allies destroyed his mortal form.</pre>

<pre>The Sacrament is an expensive medical procedure intended to forestall the aging process and increase an individual's lifespan.  It is a process secretly guarded by [[The Medica]] on the continent of [[Ruje]].  A person's life can be extended indefinitely through several procedures, which must be repeated with increasing frequency as the individual ages (at which point the procedure becomes an extensive daily routine).

!Envoys
At its core, the process is facilitated by implanting a [[Death Scarab]] that has been specifically prepared; a secret closely guarded by [[The Medica]].  Once prepared, this once rare but ordinary [[Death Scarab]] that once fed upon the detritus of carrion now can store the very essence and [[Soul]] of a living being if its flesh was to decay or die.  When these beetles undergo this process, they become known as [[Envoys|Envoy]].  Once a mortal [[Soul]] is stored within the [[Envoy]] it grants the capability to heal and restore flesh, extend life, and even transfer consciousness between bodies.

!Galvanic Rebirth
It is possible, if ones body is destroyed to recreate an empty body and transfer ones essence into it.  This is known as [[Galvanic Rebirth]].  Through complicated cloning techniques, [[The Medica]] can recreate the body of a wealthy donor.  For even higher cost, they can create a body genetically altered with strength, reflexes, or even skills.

!Side Effects
Side effects include the subjects skin acquiring a bluish hue, due to the [[Envoy]] living inside of them.  The [[Envoy]] burrows throughout the body, absorbing ones essence and can occasionally be seen beneath the skin.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/history/the-age-of-sorrow.jpg]]

The Second Age was an age of turmoil and strife.  [[Humanity|Human]] was nearly extinguished as the inter-dimensional tear created by [[The First Desecration]] belched forth creatures and powers hitherto unseen by mortal eyes.

!The Cataclysm
The sheer magnitude of the energies unleashed in [[The First Desecration]] was enough to fray the boundaries holding back the elemental chaos, spilling unbridled destruction into the world.  It reduced cities to ash and devastated [[Humanity|Human]] until there was a scant few survivors left hanging on to a thread of existence.  The landscape became a wasteland, where the eternal battle between [[The Gods]] and [[Azarad-Ji]] was fought once again.  After a prolonged conflict, [[The Gods]] stood victorious once again - and knew that if they kept [[The Divine Gate]] open, the prison of [[Azarad-Ji]] would remain imperfect and temporary.  Thus, in hopes of ensuring such a ruin would never befall [[Asha]] again, they left [[Asha]] never to return.

!The Collapse
All of the creatures and monstrosities that were born from [[The First Desecration]] began to make a foothold in [[Asha]].  The turmoil on [[Asha]] attracted many abominations.  The [[Dragons|Dragon]] came from an unknown region, adding to the chaos.  The [[Dathairä]] [[Vergadain]] aided the [[Primordials|Primordial]] to break through from [[The Elemental Planes|The Fountains Of Creation]], and they roamed free to spread destruction and devastation.

!The Divine War
The battle between [[The Gods]] and [[Azarad-Ji]] was fought simultaneously across multiple [[Planes Of Existence|The Planes Of Existence]].  [[Asha]] was not spared from the carnage, and the children of [[Azarad-Ji]], the [[Dathairä]] battled fiercely with the [[AstraKashira]].  The final battle was fought on [[Asha]] between a horde of [[Dathairä]] and the [[AstraKashira]] army known as [[The Radiant Guard]].  The final blow was struck by [[ImoMahtara]] who slaughtered [[Drelmor]] with [[The Spire Of Planes]] - a staff constructed from the multiple [[Planes Of Existence|The Planes Of Existence]].  Both [[ImoMahtara]] and [[Drelmor]] were destroyed outright, vaporized into oblivion by the power of the artifact.  The shock wave from the impact shattered [[The Spire Of Planes]], disintegrated [[Drelmor]] for eternity, and created a [[Dead Magic Zone]] which still lasts to this day known as [[The Boneyard]] in southern [[Kellos]].  The battle was known as [[The Night Of Tears]].

!The Second Desecration
[[The Second Desecration]] was the closure of [[The Cataclysm]].  The prison in which [[Azarad-Ji]] was bound, the sun, was dying; and [[The Gods]] could only repair it for eternity by closing themselves off from [[Asha]] all together and closing [[The Divine Gate]].  [[Asha's|Asha]] dying sun was an imperfect prison, and after the prolonged battle between [[The Gods]] and [[Azarad-Ji]] they moved him to a much more secure location - outside of [[The Material Plane]].

!The Humans
[[Humanity|Human]] nearly was drove to extinction as their civilization collapsed around them.  After only a few generations they were reduced to a tribal, primitive people who either attempted to continue living through deftly hiding from the newfound horrors that walked the land, or fought for their survival.  One legendary [[Human]] was [[Gydas Addonia]], whose tall tales have been passed down through oral tradition from [[The First Men]].

!The Elves And Dwarves
After the wars, [[Kombar]] and [[Lucian]] left their children upon [[Asha]] to care for and protect it, in respect for their lost sister [[Valouria]].  There was much work to do, for [[Asha]] needed much care and attention to reach its previous glory.  The [[Elves|Elf]] were created first by [[Lucian]] months before [[The Night Of Tears]] as a final blessing to [[Asha]].  [[Kombar]] breathed life into the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] soon after.

!The Gafflinz
One race that spilled forth from [[The Cataclysm]] was the [[Gafflinz]], who were ripped from an unknown dimension.  Their physiology made them immune to many of the effects of [[The Cataclysm]] and they began seeking a way home.  Their attempts to pierce into their lost home dimension created [[The Wilds]]; where they decided to reside away from the strangeness of [[Asha]].

The Shadowfell, also known as &quot;The Shadow Lands&quot; is one of [[The Planes Of Existence]]; a sister plane to [[The Material Plane]] in what scholars refer to as one of [[The Echo Planes]].  It is a dark dimension of desolate rocky wasteland, covered in shadows.  

Few adventure here and return to tell the tale, as it is a realm filled with dangerous creatures.  The first [[Human]] to explore The Shadow Lands and document its existence was [[Mysara]], Lady of Shadowy Depths.

Native to this realm are the [[Barguul]], or &quot;shadows&quot; in [[Black Speech]].  They are tormented entities that can inhabit a host body and possess and control it.  Sensing life, they seek out those who enter their domain, making them one of the most dangerous creatures to visitors.  

!The Nature Of The Shadowfell
The Shadowfell is a twisted personification of [[Valouria's|Valouria]] torment and anguish.  What fragments are left of her mind are at the core of this place. It is restless, having fits of semi-consciousness, a shadow of its former self; unable to remember who it is or why it exists. It is a place of shadow, a place of darkness, a place of illusion where one's mind and sanity is put to test. This realm is ruled by three echos of [[Valouria]] known as [[The Raven Queen]].

!Notable Locations
* [[The Tower Of The Bloody Maiden]] is the sanctum of [[The Maiden]], one of the three beings that make up [[The Raven Queen]].

The Shield Of The Hidden Lord was a powerful artifact associated with the [[Dathairä]] [[Vaecna]], who attempted to sway the [[Human]] [[Ammenon]] into bringing about a [[Desecration]].  Instead, [[Ammenon]] assimilated [[Vaecna]] into himself, and used him to gain powers unobtainable to a mortal.

In 2127 [[IO]], [[The Whispered One]] was defeated.  As [[Shalekasha]] and her companions vanquished him, the spirit of [[Vaecna]] entered into her shield, creating [[The Shield Of The Hidden Lord]].  What was once a shield of [[Adamantine]] with an angelic face twisted into a horrible visage.

Trapped inside, what little of [[Vaecna's|Vaecna]] spirit struggled to retain consciousness.  When the shield was borne however, [[Vaecna]] could speak telepathically to its wielder.  It sought to find its way back to [[Baator]] in order to be reborn anew.

!The Last Bearer
The last shieldbearer was [[Tsoofe Vedelem]], who was gifted the shield by [[Alana Underwood]].  [[Alana|Alana Underwood]] found the shield in a market in [[Palma Flora]], when [[Vaecna]] was able to persuade weak minded individuals to remove him from the villa of [[Thalamra Vanthampur]].  It was in the possession of [[Thalamra Vanthampur]] that he learned he was to be used to return his spirit to a reformed [[Ammenon]] - something [[Vaecna]] desired very strongly never to happen again.

[[Tsoofe Vedelem]] returned the shield to [[Baator]], trading it to the [[Hag]] [[Mad Maggie]] in exchange for information on how to defeat [[The Whispered One]].  [[Mad Maggie]] returned the shield to [[Gargauth Souldrinker]], who wished to bring back [[Vaecna]] to his original form.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/organizations/the-sovereign-host.jpg]]
The Sovereign Host is the religion of the [[Draugaira]] [[Elves|Elf]], a belief system that teaches that [[The Elysians|Elysian]] (known as Sovereigns) shape the living world and offer guidance and strength to those who learn to listen to them.  The followers of The Sovereign Host believe that it is important to honor each Sovereign in their own place and time.  By doing so, they can hear the voice of the Sovereigns.  They believe that the hand of the Sovereigns can be seen in all things and that by embracing their path, they can learn to see and hear the Sovereigns more clearly.

!History
The history of The Sovereign Host religion dates back to the creation of the [[Draugaira]] [[Elves|Elf]] by their [[God|The Gods]], [[Lucian]]. It was [[Lucian]] who gave them the task to spread the word of [[The Gods]] to [[Humans|Human]], before she left beyond [[The Divine Gate]]. The [[Draugaira]] [[Elves|Elf]] had taken this task seriously and dedicated themselves to the task of spreading the message of the Sovereigns.

!Faith And Reverence
As a result of their belief in The Sovereign Host, the [[Draugaira]] [[Elves|Elf]] hold deep reverence for the natural world and its inhabitants. They see the cycles of life and death as an integral part of the Sovereigns' plan and often engage in rituals and ceremonies to honor the Sovereigns and give thanks for their blessings.

In times of need, the followers of The Sovereign Host often turn to their faith for guidance and strength. The Sovereigns are believed to be with them at all times, offering comfort and support in times of trouble. The [[Draugaira]] [[Elves|Elf]] see their faith as a source of great strength, both individually and as a community, and they hold it in high esteem as a result.

[[Kombar]] is the Sovereign who stands at every forge. He is associated with the elements of fire and earth, and his teachings revolve around craftsmanship, hard work, and determination. [[Xander]] is with those who draw blades and weapons, and embodies the ideals of courage, valor, and honor. [[Lucian]] is witnessed in a bountiful harvest, and can be felt around nature, growth, and the cycles of life. [[Qualok]] guides those who hunger for and seek knowledge, assisting with learning and discovery, and his teachings focus on wisdom and understanding.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/items/artifacts/spire-of-planes.jpg]]
The Spire Of Planes was an artifact wielded by the [[AstraKashira]] [[ImoMahtara]] in the battle that ended [[The Second Age]] known as [[The Night Of Tears]].  The staff was forged by [[Kombar]] using materials gathered across seven of [[The Planes Of Existence]].  To bind the forging, a great sacrifice was made - [[Xander]] gave freely his own sight, knowing that this was the final hope for imprisoning [[Azarad-Ji]] once more.

As [[Xander]] would no longer be able to wield it in battle himself, he gave it to [[Lucian]] who met [[Azarad-Ji]] and his forces on [[Asha]] itself.  [[Lucian]] wielded it in his stead, at the vanguard of an army of her [[AstraKashira]] clad in gleaming golden armor.  The forces of darkness were led by [[Drelmor]], standing at the side of [[Azarad-Ji]] himself.  The battle raged for years in mortal time, a near stalemate until [[Lucian]] was able to strike [[Azarad-Ji]] with a piercing blow from the Spire.  She seized the opportunity to begin a deadly struggle to subdue [[Azarad-Ji]].  [[Drelmor]] rushed to [[Azarad-Ji's|Azarad-Ji]] aid, striking [[Lucian]] in a near fatal blow - causing her to drop the staff.

A brave [[AstraKashira]] foot soldier named [[ImoMahtara]] leaped from the fray, gliding towards [[Lucian]] to protect her.  Bloodied from battle, [[ImoMahtara]] blocked [[Drelmor's|Drelmor]] attack with her shield - then grasped for The Spire Of Planes within the dirt, stabbing it at [[Drelmor]].  The impact sent a shockwave large enough to bring all of the armies to their knees.  A bright light burst from the Spire, and vaporized [[Drelmor]], the prized son of [[Azarad-Ji]].  The rod shattered, splintering into seven parts.  Thus ending the battle, and [[The Second Age]].  [[Lucian]] quickly imprisoned [[Azarad-Ji]], and [[Xander]] gave his life to seal [[The Divine Gate]].

The pieces of the Spire were found by [[Alana Underwood]], [[Tsoofe Vedelem]], [[Ulan Nailo]], and [[Juro Allast]] and reforged by [[Gundren Rockseer]] using the [[Primordial]] forge found in [[Avorbarath]] in 1025 [[AAP]].

The Summer Court is a vibrant and flourishing realm within [[The Feywild]], embodying the height of nature's bounty and the brilliance of the sun. This court is a place of warmth, light, and life, where the air is filled with the scent of blooming flowers, the sound of rustling leaves, and the laughter of its inhabitants. The Summer Court is a realm of eternal midsummer, where the days are never ending, and the energy of life is at its peak.

!The Pursuit of Perfection
[[Lady Kalamantri]], is known for her unyielding desire for perfection, and is used to getting what she wants.  In her Court, every detail is meticulously curated to meet her exacting standards. The gardens are always in full bloom, with each flower carefully arranged to create a harmonious display of color and form. The forests are lush and verdant, with every tree and blade of grass growing in perfect symmetry. The rivers and lakes are crystal clear, reflecting the brilliance of the sun and the beauty of the landscape. Every element of The Summer Court is a reflection of [[Lady Kalamantri's|Lady Kalamantri]] vision of beauty and order.

However, this pursuit of perfection comes at a cost. [[Lady Kalamantri's|Lady Kalamantri]] subjects are constantly striving to meet her expectations, knowing that even the smallest flaw could earn her displeasure. While she is not cruel, her demands for perfection can be exhausting, and those who serve her often feel the pressure to maintain the flawless appearance of The Summer Court. Yet, despite this, her subjects love and revere her, for they know that her meticulous nature stems from a deep love for her realm and its inhabitants.

The Great Sylvan Empire was a large and vast civilization very much unlike that of modern day [[Elves|Elf]].  This empire was the precursor of the [[Forana'loloKashira]], a time in which the [[Elves|Elf]] lived in large stone cities and ruled over one another in strict governmental fashion.  The [[Elves|Elf]] lived under their magnificent empire for nearly 6,000 years between 8022 [[IO]] and 2127 [[IO]], until a horror befell their civilization at its greatest peak.  [[Azarad-Ji]] and his [[Dathairä]] tempted and tainted the [[Elves|Elf]] into what the [[Elves|Elf]] call [[The Third Desecration]].

When the [[Kiragä|Kiraga]] had been forced into hiding and the [[Dathairä]] pushed back into the wild lands, many thousands were dead.  But those [[Varigellë]] that survived had no kingdom to return to.  Some did go to the forests and joined the [[Elves|Elf]] that became the [[Forana'loloKashira]].  Most found no comfort in the carefree woodland dwellings, dinging that war was all they remembered.  The restless ones gathered together in the plains and formed the first tribe of the [[Variona'Sha]].  This clan grew and continued keeping the [[Varigellë Code Of Honor]] as their highest law.  The clan split and their culture spread throughout the realm.

!Cities &amp; Structures of the Empire
*[[Velefanaefe]] was located where the current city of [[Bandor]] now stands.
*The [[Temple Of Acharutha]] stood on the edge of [[Lake Acharutha]] and is now a [[gallery of Elven artifacts|The Acharutha Gallery]]
*The city of [[Laranor]] was built on an elven city - [[The Temple Of Laranor]] was an Elven structure
*[[The Amphitheater]] of [[Bandor]] is the remains of an Elvish Colloseum

The Temple Of [[Laranor]] is a proud monument for the [[The Divine Order]].  It is the only building in the city that is of [[Elven|The Sylvan Empire]] design and creation.  The walls of the temple are cut from a dark black stone who’s exact origins are unknown.  At close glance, one will notice that the black walls have a marbleized appearance that seems to shimmer and dance as the eyes dart across it.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/history/the-sylvan-age.jpg]]

The Third Age was an age of enlightenment and prosperity.  While [[Humanity|Human]], [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] and [[Elven|Elf]] civilizations flourished, the Age was dominated by the [[Elves|Elf]] - which is why this Age is known as The Age Of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  

!The Sylvan Empire
The [[Elven|Elf]] civilization thrived and reached a level of enlightenment and prosperity unseen in previous Ages.  They created an [[Empire|The Sylvan Empire]] that spanned multiple continents, powered by magic lost to present day magicians.  [[The Sylvan Empire]] had access to domains of magic such as [[Travelling]], [[Time Manipulation]], and [[Enchantment]].  Prior to [[The Third Desecration]], the [[Elves|Elf]] experimented with [[Foretelling]] - resulting in the foretelling of the fall of [[The Sylvan Empire]] and the [[BahaUlla Prophecy]].  Their lust for power corrupted and blinded them, causing [[The Third Desecration]].

!The Rise Of Ammenon
On the continent now known as [[Amon]], the rise of [[Human]] colonies vexed the [[Draugaira Elves|Draugaira]].  Forests that had stood for centuries fell under the axes of creatures who lived only a scant few decades.  These tensions did not rise to war, but the [[Humans|Human]] gnawed at peace like termites.

This first [[Human]] civilization of The Third Age was brutal and cruel, built by a handful of self-entitled nobles who stacked the laws and structure in their favor.  Slavery, brutality, and [[Corruption]] spread through the region.  A young man named [[Ammenon]], born from an underprivileged class, was a victim of this savagery - and as such began seeking revenge.  He eventually assumed a mastery of [[Blood Magic]] achieved by no mortal since.  Building a terrible army, he conquered the [[Human]] lands of [[Amon]] and then with intense fervor turned his attention on the ashen skin [[Draugaira]] who he slaughtered by the thousands in order to achieve immortality an eventually seek to claim his own godhood.  He was thwarted, and is fabled now only as [[The Whispered One]] with a small number of cultists (known as [[The Remnant]]) that seek to bring him back.

!The Third Desecration
[[The Third Desecration]] began from within [[The Sylvan Empire]], when the [[Dathairä]] [[Zezebazum]] used the [[Elven|Elf]] hubris to corrupt the [[Kiraga]] and tear apart [[The Sylvan Empire]] from the inside.  The [[Elf]] [[Raime Wesewierë]] was able to influence and thwart [[Zezebazum]] and the [[Kiraga]] such that the impact was contained to the [[Elves|Elf]] rather than sending [[Asha]] into another dark age.</pre>

<pre>The tale of the Third Desecration is a long and complicated one.  [[Raime Wesewierë]] himself, the antagonist through a large part of the story never wrote an account of what happened, and the [[Forana'loloKashira]] remain silent of the event.  The [[Variona'Sha]] tell the fragments they have of the story, such that history will not be repeated, and [[Raime Wesewierë]]'s legacy will not go unremembered.  It accounts a tale of fallen [[Elves|Elf]] known as [[Kiraga]] who were corrupted by the demon [[Zezebazum]].  Together, they schemed to bring about the fall of [[The Sylvan Empire]] around the year 2127 [[IO]].</pre>

In 8302 [[IO]], the [[AstraKashira]] of [[Elysium]] initiated a system of harvesting [[Mortal Souls|Soul]] from [[Asha]].  This was a decision of their own making, after [[The Gods]] locked themselves behind [[The Divine Gate]].  [[Lucian's|Lucian]] final guidance to [[The Seven]] was that the mortals of [[Asha]] were to be protected, and were far more capable than originally imagined.

!There Must Be Balance
There was much debate within [[The Seven]] if [[Mortal Souls|Soul]] should be permitted into [[Elysium]].  As demanded by [[The Eternal Cycle]], all things must be balanced.  Allowing [[Souls|Soul]] into [[Elysium]] would cause [[Souls|Soul]] to also enter [[Baator]].  It was decided amongst much debate that while capable of both great evil and great good, their capacity for good surpasses that of the [[AstraKashira]] themselves.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/ruje/tszanthus/trivardum.jpg]]
Nestled amidst the vibrant chaos of [[The Lower Streap]] of [[Tszanthus]] within [[Ruje]] is The Trivardum.  This collection of buildings stands as a living testament to the city's rich history, diverse culture, and unending appetite for novelty.  As the sun rises over the sprawling district, this marketplace springs to life with an energy that's both infectious and intoxicating.

!A Melting Pot Of Sights and Aromas
The Trivardum assaults the senses with an array of scents and explosion of colors that draw passersby like moths to a flame.  Vibrant fabrics hang from makeshift awnings, catching the sunlight in a riot of hues.  Vendors expertly display their goods in colorful stalls, creating a haphazard maze that dazzles and delights and invites visitors to lose themselves in its riches.

The building itself sprawls across a sizable area, divided loosely into thematic sections, each devoted to specific goods - spices, textiles, artifacts, and even exotic animals - offering a journey of discovery for those who wander through its lanes.  Merchants come here from everyone in the city in order to barter and buy goods at a wholesale price to resell in other sections of the city.  Here you can find many items from across [[The Freeholds Of The Hegemony|The Hegemony]].

<pre>The Undercity is the affectionate name for the sprawling labyrinth of tunnels, caverns, and ruins that lay beneath of city of [[Tszanthus]] on the continent of [[Ruje]].  The origins of The Undercity are shrouded in mystery, with some historians suggesting that it predates the founding of [[Tszanthus]] itself.  Layers upon layers of forgotten culture lay untouched and forgotten beneath the city streets.  The modern city sits on top of the detritus of its predecessor cities, arching back into time over three millennia. Many cellars are the foundations of ancient buildings, some only a stone wall separating them from an underground labyrinth that is a hidden city of spectacular ancient remains, frigid waters, peculiar animals, and powerful odors. Explorers will find abandoned theaters, baths, stadium, villas, and temples; as [[Tszanthian|Tszanthus]] architects frequently tore the roofs from old buildings and filled their interiors with dirt to make solid foundations for new structures. When dirt was unavailable, they entombed earlier buildings in tremendous landfills that raised the ground level of the entire city by several yards.

!Notable Locations and Layers
* ''The Burrows'' - the uppermost level, closest to the surface are known to many as The Burrows.  Small chambers and tunnels that are difficult to traverse, and occasionally have openings in forgotten places across the city.  The poor and homeless use them as a place of refuge.  It is within The Burrows that [[Mother Pidna]] and [[The Little Lambs]] operate within [[The Lower Streap]].
* ''The Crypts'' - beneath The Burrows is the remnant of a [[Dwarven|Duergar'Ran]] fortress.  So ancient, it was lost to memory of even the [[Duergar'Ran]].
* ''The Caverns'' - deeper still are are vast natural caves, home to deep dwelling creatures such as the [[Atlaca]]; small, silent creatures that resemble bipedal Axolotls and communicate telepathically.
* ''The Forgotten City'' - often left undiscovered, the relics found here show evidence of an ancient, forgotten civilization of [[Yuan-Ti]].  It is here, the secretive [[Dweomorcore|The Dweomorcore]] can be found.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/the-valourian-veil.jpg]]
The Valourian Veil is a mythical spring which is the source of [[Valouria's|Valouria]] power, allegedly able to grant life and vitality to anyone who drinks or bathes in its waters.  The Veil was painstakingly crafted by the third and most complex of [[Kombar's|Kombar]] golems, named [[Zenriah]].  Upon finishing construction, [[Kombar]] himself interred [[Valouria's|Valouria]] essence within the Veil and commanded [[Zenriah]] to stand an eternal vigil.

The Valourian Veil, in all of its serene majesty, exudes an ambiance of tranquility, where the hushed whispers and gentle breeze induces a dreamlike drowsiness.  The water is inviting, and smells of fond childhood memories long forgotten.  Those who would enter would feel a somber sense of melancholy in the very soil.  The flowers that sit at the edge of the living waters remain frozen in a state of eternal bloom, a testament to the timeless beauty that the Veil imparts upon its surroundings.

Those who partake of the water are rejuvenated to their youth, all ailments, wounds, and [[Curses|Afflictions]] upon them vanishing before their eyes.  Even those who have suffered the loss of limbs find themselves whole once more, as if the passage of time had never marked them.  Yet, this divine gift comes at a staggering cost.  The waters are enchanting and addictive to those of weak will and moral characters, finding themselves ensnared with insatiable thirst that compels them to drink until they are fully absorbed by the embrace of the Veil; losing themselves and becoming part of it.  They begin to age backward, regressing into childhood.  This process continues until they gradually cease to exist, merging with the timeless essence of The Veil.

!The Guardian Of The Veil
The crystal golem [[Zenriah]], creation of [[Kombar]] constructed the Veil and acted as its first guardian.  The [[Archfey]] [[Babaroga]] discovered The Valourian Veil in her quest to understand [[Humanity|Human]] and the source of their [[Soul]].  Upon stumbling upon The Veil, she found [[Zenriah]] and slayed him in a fierce and equally matched battle.  While gravely wounded, her wounds were healed by the waters of The Veil.

[[Babaroga]] recognized the importance to the reverence of The Veil, and felt sorrow for her slaying of its only champion.  Taking on the mantle of guardian, she has vowed to protect the waters of The Veil from the greed and [[Corruption]] of others.  She holds the single key to the forgotten and mystical source of [[Valouria's|Valouria]] life force.  This magical nexus is the spring from which all [[Souls|Soul]] originate.  She imbued a flower to contain her [[Soul]] and planted it inside The Veil, protecting her so that she can never truely die unless the flower is destroyed.</pre>

!Structure and Origin
A year on [[Asha]] lasts 360 days over the course of 12 months.  Each day is 24 hours in length and months are separated into three [[Tendays|Tenday]] (a grouping of 10 day weeks).  This system of measurement was established in 124 [[AAP]] by [[Elegabalus Salvis Viridian]] to unify and correct the various dating and calendaring systems and mark the birth of [[The Viridian Empire]]; it is now the most common measurement of time used throughout the world.

!Marking The Years
The Viridian Calendar segments years into two sections; time before [[The Viridian Empire]] and time after.  Year 1 marks the year the [[Empire|The Viridian Empire]] was conceived, followed by consecutive year numbers.  These years are denoted by following the year with the letters [[AAP]] which in [[The Amoni Language|Amoni]] is an abbreviation of [[Anno Autum Populus|AAP]] which translates to &quot;In The Year Of The People&quot;.  Years prior to this are counted backwards and followed by the letters [[IO]] which is abbreviation of [[In Obscuro|IO]], translated to &quot;In Obscurity&quot;.

<pre>The Voice is a [[Magical Talent|Magic]] that enables those trained in it to pitch their voice to register on a living subject's subconscious mind, driving them to action even against their own volition.  Only those adept in the [[Bardic Way|Bard]] are able to have the necessary control over their voice and body that allow for such subtle control over the mind.

The downside of this ability is that if overused on a individual or population to bend their will, they begin to become immune to it; able to more easily resist.

!Cosmography
The Void is far from homogeneous.  It is comprised of an opaque, brilliant, multicolored ether that acts as a fluid but does not resemble any of the known elements.  This fluid varies in density from place to place, with currents and eddies that cause the The Void to flow like a river in some parts.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/organizations/the-way.jpg]]
The Way is a religious faith, and is most prevalent where it originated on the continent of [[Uskard]].  It espouses a philosophy that there are no separation between forces of good, evil, chaos and law, but only interconnected and interrelated forces that followers of The Way can shape.  It is known that a form of The Way was been practiced by [[Humans|Human]] of [[The First Age]].  This makes it the longest surviving practiced [[Religion]] on [[Asha]].

!Dogma
Adherents of The Way hold that [[The Elder Gods]], [[The Gods]], [[Dathairä]] and other immortal entities are all parts of the same whole.  They see these entities as forces of nature, no different than [[Mana]] or Gravity; and endeavor to understand the best way to use and manipulate these forces.  It is seen that the universe is like a sheet of cloth, and that if one pulled on a thread, it would have an equal and opposite effect somewhere else on the tapestry.
The faithful of The Way are divided into to four distinct ideologies, [[The Obsidian Path]], [[The Vermilion Path]], [[The Alabaster Path]] and [[The Golden Path]].  While all are devout followers of The Way, and share similar beliefs, practices, and fellowship; each sect possess their own doctrine.

| [[The Golden Path]] |argues that there are no superior beings, only enlightened beings, and only through the difficult practice of action through inaction is harmony and balance achieved. They are seen by the other sects as having all logic and no heart. |
| [[The Obsidian Path]] |asserts that a superior being was obligated to shape the forces of the universe to better the world.  They want only to manipulate any threads of the tapestry (good / evil / chaos / law) in order to &quot;save the world&quot; and better themselves and their kind. |
| [[The Alabaster Path]] |believes with practice and discipline, one can achieve great power, adding one's own thread to the tapestry. |
| [[The Vermilion Path]] |see an impending war between the superior forces, and seek to prepare themselves and the world for this battle.  They seek to weaken the fabric of the tapestry, to tip the balance in their favor when they will be needed most. |

!Supernatural Beings
Followers of The Way understand that all living creatures, including [[The Gods]] and [[Dathairä]] are bound to the universe; and even the most powerful of beings must abide by fundamental forces of nature.

!Sayings
It is common for those who follow The Way to say goodbye with the words &quot;May your path lead you to The Way&quot;</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/events/the-weeping.jpg]]
The Weeping is the name of the catastrophic event that struck the city of [[Tszanthus]] on the continent of [[Ruje]] on [[Hassomir]] 1268 (1026 [[AAP]]).  It is one of the most catastrophic and haunting events in the history of the city.  It refers to the sudden and unexplained deaths of tens of thousands of citizens in a single, horrific moment, which left the city in shock, despair and confusion.

!Origins
The root cause of The Weeping can be traced back to a malfunctioning ancient [[Elven|Elf]] artifact known as a [[Reliquary]], designed by [[Niiralagaaerä]] to capture and reincarnate the [[Souls|Soul]] of deceased [[Elves|Elf]] into newborn [[Elven|Elf]] bodies.  The [[Reliquary]] was placed deep in a secret [[Vault|The Golden Vault]] in [[The Undercity]] on [[Hassomir]] 1188 (946 [[AAP]]), spearheaded by the crime lord [[Ethufaera]], who sought to bring about a [[Draugaira]] enlightenment.  For over sixty years, [[the artifact|Reliquary]] has been malfunctioning, incorrectly placing [[Elven|Elf]] [[Souls|Soul]] into [[Human]] bodies and even doubling or tripling [[Souls|Soul]] within a single individual, leading to madness.

!The Event
Unknown by all but a small few, on the day of The Weeping it was [[Rithseril]], the husband of [[Niiralagaaerä]], who attempted to correct the errors of the [[Reliquary]] through arcane means.  While repairing [[the artifact|Reliquary]], [[Rithseril]] triggered The Weeping.  In an effort to restore balance, [[Rithseril]] forcibly recalled all [[Elven|Elf]] [[Souls|Soul]] which had been previously misplaced, leading to the sudden deaths of hundreds of thousands of [[Humans|Human]] whose bodies had been imbued with these displaced [[Souls|Soul]].

Men, women, and children of all social standing - from the poorest slum-dwellers to the wealthiest [[Aurum]] - collapsed without warning, their lives snuffed out as if by an invisible hand.  In the streets, people wept openly, horrified by the inexplicable deaths of their loved ones.  The sheer scale of the event overwhelmed the city's healers and doctors, who could offer no explanations or solace.

The bodies piled in the streets, their number so great that disposal became a logistical nightmare.  The citizens of [[Tszanthus]], gripped by fear and desperation, began to refer to the event as &quot;The Weeping&quot;, both for the tears that were shed and for the way the [[Souls|Soul]] seemed to have been forcibly pulled from the bodies, as if they were crying out in pain.

!Aftermath
In the wake of The Weeping, [[Tszanthus]] was left a city of mourning.  The streets were filled with hastily constructed memorials, and [[The Rhill]], the river that runs through the city, became a burial ground as bodies were dumped into its waters to prevent the spread of disease.  The social and political ramifications of The Weeping were profound.  Some blamed a [[Magical|Magic]] event related to the [[Highstorm]], others a curse or divine punishment.  Others suspected foul play by the city's hidden cabals or even foreign enemies.  Paranoia and rumors spread like wildfire.</pre>

The Westron Wall is the largest stone fortification in the realms.  It stretches from [[Lake Acharutha]] to the southern mountain ranges.  Built nearly 3,000 years ago in the year 1776 [[IO]] to push [[barbarians|Kell]] away from the newly settled areas within what is now [[The Green Sea]] in what was known as [[The Kellish Wars]].

The wall began as a simple dirt fortification, and reinforced with stone up to 1768 [[IO]] when the wars ended.  In modern times, the wall remains a relic of times passed.  The area beyond the wall is known as [[The Northlands]], and many of the people that dwell there still retain the spirit and bloodline of the original [[barbarians|Kell]], although they are free citizens of [[The Viridian Empire]].  In the far north, there still remain a small group of nomadic people whose practices still mirror those of their ancient ancestors.</pre>

''-The Whispered One''
}}}
The Whispered One, has many names and titles; The Maimed God, The Dying King, The Lord Of The Rotting Tower, The Undying.  He was a [[Human]] of [[The Third Age]] named [[Ammenon]] who rose to prominence and created [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]] in modern day [[Amon]].  His capital and home was in the now lost city of [[Tar Barog]].

This first [[Human]] civilization of [[The Third Age]] was brutal and cruel, built by a handful of self-entitled nobles who stacked the laws and structure in their favor.  Slavery, brutality, and corruption spread through the region.  A young man named [[Ammenon]], born in 3253 [[IO]] to an underprivileged class, was a victim of this savagry - and as such began seeking revenge.  He eventually assumed a mastery of [[Blood Magic]] achieved by no mortal since.  Building a terrible army, he conquered the [[Human]] lands of what is now [[Amon]] and formed [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]].

With an intense fervor, he turned his attention on the ashen skin [[Draugaira]] who he slaughtered by the thousands in order to achieve immortality and eventually seek to claim his own godhood.  The [[Draugaira]] put up a valiant fight, but were quickly overwhelmed by the ferocity of The Whispered One's undead forces.  They made their final stand in the city of [[Esserosse]] (&quot;The Mist Palace&quot; in [[Elvish]]) - where the [[AstraKashira]] [[Shalekasha]] came to their aid but was slain and corrupted by The Whispered One.  All hope lost, the [[Draugaira]] faded into history.

He was finally thwarted by the prophet [[Poulcheria]], and is fabled now only as The Whispered One with a small number of cultists (known as [[The Remnant]]) that seek to bring him back.

In 1025 [[AAP]], he rose again with the help from [[The Remnant]].  Seeking to once again use [[The Ritual Of Seeding]] to attain the godhood that was denied him millennia before.  He was thwarted by [[Alana Underwood]], [[Ulan Nailo]], [[Tsoofe Vedelem]], and [[Juro Allast]]

<pre>[&gt;img[images/organizations/the-whispers.jpg]]
The Whispers are a secret organization working for [[The Amoni Concord]] of magically trained assassins and spies that work directly for the [[Tribunes]].  Members undergo a ritual known as [[The Harrowing]] that destroys the identity they once held.  Members are often young children who were deemed unwanted, with few connections to the world which make [[The Harrowing]] easier to undergo.  Not everyone survives [[The Harrowing]], and it is considered an honor to succeed.  The organization raises the children as their own, the only family they know are other Whispers.

!Ghost Stories
The Whispers are regarded by most citizens as ghost stories and urban legends often told to children as bogeymen to warn against disobeying parents or staying out too late.  They keep a low profile, and have no identification or connection through family, relationship or documentation.  While the [[Tribunes|Tribune]] have the ability to call on The Whispers, they often do so reluctantly.  The Whispers are so discrete and precise in their actions and work that the [[Tribunes|Tribunes]] question the authority and influence The Whispers wield.

!The Harrowing
[[The Harrowing]] is a ritual that initiates a Whisper into the organization.  Not many within the organization understand the details around how [[The Harrowing]] works, and they know better than to ask questions.  It has its roots in [[Blood Magic]] and [[Sorcery]], and is a painful and traumatic experience to both those who witness and participate.
Those that look into the eyes of A Whisper realize that they have faced darkness and unimaginable horror and that they are no stranger to the darkness.  They are haunted and broken by something so terrible that they can not put words to it, bury, or run away from it.  Their haunt can not be slain with sword or banished by spell and comes to them as shadows on the wall, a memory that refuses to die, and demonic whispers in the dark.  This burden takes its toll, isolating them from most people and makes them question their sanity.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/organizations/the-wild-hunt.jpg]]
The Wild Hunt is the name given to the event that occurs every 500 years within [[The Feywild]].  It occurs with [[The Conjunction Of The Echo Planes]], when the veil between worlds is thin.  It is a barbaric display of fulfilling base and wanton desires, showcasing the true chaos of the [[Fey]].  It is looked down upon as unseemly by the [[Archfey]], but seen as a mark of power by those of lesser station.

!The Horned King
[[The Horned King]] is the mysterious rider and organizer of The Wild Hunt.  They are anonymous, wearing spiked armor and riding a dark black [[Pegasus]].  It is [[The Horned King]] that opens the portal between worlds and leads the hunt.  They are as merciless as they are mute, hiding their true identity.  While many wish to uncover who is behind the helmet, everyone is too afraid to ask for fear of the end of the hunt forever.

!Leylines
The Wild Hunt must stay within the boundaries of the [[Leylines]] that are the skeletal frame of [[The Echo Planes]].  While it is possible for a [[Fey]] in the hunt to wander further, they risk becoming lost and not finding their way back.

!Predator And Prey
The participants of the hunt are fickle and chaotic in their approach.  They think of themselves as apex predators in the food chain, preying upon the mortal population.  The hunt creates self imposed challenges to create more thrill, and &quot;play&quot; with their prey like a cat with a mouse.  The Hunt is like a vacation in which they over-indulge and partake in all of the mortal delicacies including death.

!Redcaps
A [[Redcap]] is a title given to a [[Fey]] who draws blood during The Wild Hunt.  They dye their cloak in the blood of their victims and wear the cloak proudly during ceremonial events for [[The Court Of Stars]].  Some [[Redcaps|Redcap]] participate in a single hunt and satiate their base desires forever, never to return.  Others thirst for the hunt and return faithfully; each hunt growing more savage. </pre>

The Wilds are a pocket [[dimension|The Planes Of Existence]] created by the [[Gafflinz]] after [[The First Desecration]] in an attempt to return to their home plane.  Few know of the existing of The Wilds, and only [[Gafflinz]] live here.  The Wilds are [[Mana]] dead, meaning no magic items or spells work within this realm.  It is completely dark, even creatures with [[Dark Vision]] require illumination to see effectively.  Imagine a great empty void, with platforms connected by paths and stairways.  Gravity in this dimension is fickle and objective, always pointing &quot;down&quot; however stairways, paths and platforms are in such a way that travelers will find themselves walking up walls or on stairways that hang them above the spiraling maze of platforms.

!Home Of The Secretive Gafflinz
The [[Gafflinz]], recognizing they are trapped in the universe of [[Asha]], created a new technology-rich civilization deep within the inky depths of The Wilds.  These cities are dotted across the plane, connected by long pathways and cables that float within the vast dark emptiness.  These paths are haphazard in their design, and are maze-like even for the [[Gafflinz]].  Wayposts are stationed at intersections with [[Gafflinz]] use to direct themselves to [[Gateways|Gafflinz Gateway]] and cities; however these wayposts are written in a cypher that is near impossible for those who are not a [[Gafflinz]] to understand.

!Gafflinz Gateways
[[Gateways|Gafflinz Gateway]] are metal monstrosities of clockwork gears and metal.  Opening the gateway requires the deft skill of a 12 fingered creature, triggering small hidden buttons and switches deep in the recesses of the seemingly carved doorway.  Operating a [[Gateway|Gafflinz Gateway]] is complex, equivalent to solving a puzzle in order to calibrate the [[Gateway|Gafflinz Gateway]] for safe travel.

!The Glorious Cities
The cities are technological marvels.  Thriving perfect utopias of civilization, with [[Gafflinz]] living in harmony, happily toiling away in unified scholarly study.  Each city is a self contained institution of knowledge, deftly positioned within The Wilds to capitalize on the sparse resources of the native environment.  The populace of the city dedicate their lifetimes to the pursuit of an answer to a single question.  These questions are large and open ended, and are rarely if ever answered - although new theories are generated constantly.  Some questions are how to get home?  what is life?  where did [[The Elder Gods]] originate from?  why does magic not work on us?  Leaders of these cities are considered [[Professors]] and are elected for life.  They are trusted with the deepest secrets.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/the-feywild/the-winter-court/the-winter-court.jpg]]
The Winter Court, ruled by [[Lord Filvenedore]] is a realm of stark beauty and relentless cold within [[The Feywild]].  This domain is a land where ice and snow dominate, and the light of the sun is pale and fleeting.  The Winter Court is a place of serene stillness and a harsh, unforgiving landscape.  Survival is a testament to strength and resilience.

!Geography
The Winter Court is a vast and desolate land, characterized by its extreme cold and breathtaking and foreboding beauty.  The landscape is dominated by towering mountains covered in ice and snow, their peaks lost in a perpetual storm.  Between these mountains lie frozen valleys and tundras, where the ground is hard as stone and the air bites with a chill that can freeze the flesh of mortals in seconds.

The sky above often swirls with the colorful [[The Aurora Borealis]], a beautiful but haunting display created by the sleeping [[Queen]] [[Naurase]].  Rivers of ice flow through The Winter Court, their waters frozen solid for most of the year.  These icy rivers carve deep gorges through the realm, creating natural barriers that are difficult to traverse.  The few forests that exist in this realm are made of ancient, twisted trees covered in frost, their branches creaking ominously under the weight of snow.  The Winter Court is a land of isolation, where the only warmth comes from within, and where the beauty of the landscape is matched only by its danger.

He holds mortals and non-[[Fey]] in contempt, seeing them as fickle and untrustworthy.  [[Lord Filvenedore]] does not delight in the merrymaking and adornment of flowers and beauty like his allies.

[[Akut]] shares a deep, unbreakable bond with [[Lord Filvenedore]], serving as his trusted general in the relentless war against the [[Fomorians|Fomorian]].  Together, they partake in [[The Wild Hunt]], where [[Akut]] bears [[Lord Filvenedore]] in a vain attempt to seek a cure for [[Queen]] [[Naurase]] by collecting the blood of mortals.

The statue of [[Mysara]] is of a woman with long hair with an open book in one hand, mystical energy engulfing the other.  A ferret hangs around her neck.  Her hair flickers between red and stone grey - and waves in a false breeze.  [[Fazar]] strikes an imposing figure - bald and muscular.  His vest bares his arms that are decorated with tattoos running down their length.  He holds two scimitars which he has crossed in front of his body.  His tattoos and swords glow faintly blue.  The final statue is of [[Armondax]] with a neatly trimmed beard and mustache and a wry smile.  His elaborate and ornate cape and waistcoat are emblazoned with dragons.  His left hand is on a wand pointing down at his side, his right hand has flames on his index finger which he has pointing up.  His eyes appear to follow you, his smile widening.

Thermon Verik (c. 916 [[AAP]] to 998 [[AAP]]) was a local wizard/farmer who is looking for a quiet life in the city of [[Laranor]].  He ran his farm almost completely without farmhands using [[Wizardry]].  In 975 [[AAP]] at close to 60 years of age, he was one of the primary follower of [[Gavar Joro]], a local priest who spoke out against [[The Divine Order]].  It was his farmhouse that was used for the initial meetings of [[The Followers Of Joro]].

Thermon Verik was a long standing member of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].</pre>

Thog Stoneheart (c 980 [[AAP]] - 1025 [[AAP]]) was the [[Dean]] of the [[Lower School]] of [[The Athenaeum]] and professor of [[Conjuration]] [[Magic]].  He was a [[Goliath]] from the northern reaches of [[Kellos]], hailing from beyond the civilized lands.  He was muscular and strong, and had tribal tattoos along his head and chest.  His tattoos represent significant moments in both his and his tribe's history.  As a child, his tribe taught him the ways of the [[Barbarian]], as he follows the [[Primal Path]] of the [[Ancestral Guardian]].  This allows his ancestors to assist him in battle.

Thog is the son of [[Vamir Stoneheart]], who was the tribal leader.  When Vamir passed away peacefully, a new tribal leader was required.  Every [[Barbarian]] who follows the [[Primal Path]] of the [[Ancestral Guardian]] has an ancestor who watches over them.  [[Vamir Stoneheart]] began to watch over Thog, making him a natural choice to lead the tribe.  However, Thog was bested by his brother [[Kovak Stoneheart]] and forced to leave the tribe in exile.  [[The Sky Forged Maul]], a large hammer made by the tribe's ancestors from a meteor, and symbol of leadership, passed to [[Kovak Stoneheart]].  While Thog is unaware, [[Kovak Stoneheart]] poisoned his own father, and bested Thog using trickery and deceit (something that is dishonorable in the tribes eyes).

In exile, Thog found his way to the city of [[Kohor]] - where he worked to reinvent himself.  There he learned [[Wizardry]], which he took to easily.  His [[Familiar]] was a hawk named [[Omen|Thog Stoneheart's Familiar]].

Thog was killed protecting [[Nester Arkwood]] from an attack on [[The Athenaeum]] in 1025 [[AAP]] by [[Harmost Xawn]] and [[Penelope Kensington]] in an attempt to bring about the resurrection of [[The Whispered One]].  This event is known as [[The Black Night]].

<pre>Omen was a [[Familiar]] of the [[Wizard|Wizardry]] [[Thog Stoneheart]], of [[The Athenaeum]].  He took the form of a red blood hawk, and was skilled in tracking like his master.  Upon [[Thog's|Thog Stoneheart]] death in 1025 [[AAP]], Omen was left in the care of [[Salix Daelof]], keeper of [[The Menagerie]] in [[The Athenaeum]].
Omen loved adventure and the open sky beneath his wings.  While his master lived, they would both enjoy the quite solitude of the mountainous [[Northlands|The Northlands]] of [[Kellos]].  Since [[Thog's|Thog Stoneheart]] demise, Omen sits quietly inside [[The Menagerie]] - a shadow of his former self.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/tiefling.jpg]]
A Tiefling is a [[Planetouched]] who bears the mark of [[Baator]].  In rural parts of [[Asha]] they may be first met with mistrust, then curiosity - or in more backwards areas of [[Asha]], fear.  The Tiefling carry to physical appearance of either direct contact with [[Baator]], or an ancestor who was [[Planetouched]] - which they and their children and their children's children will always carry.

!Infernal Bloodline
Tiefling's are derived from the joining of [[Human]] and [[Dathairä]] bloodlines.  While they still appear [[Human]], the infernal heritage is clearly visible.  These traits manifest in a variety of shapes and ways; horns, tails, canine teeth, solid colored eyes, and abhorrent skin tones.

!Self Reliant and Suspicious
Tiefling's are a minority in [[Asha]], and are mostly found within [[Human]] cities or towns; often in the roughest quarters of those places.  Tiefling's have no place to call their own, unfit for [[Baator]], and likewise untrusted among the civilized [[Races]].  Tieflings must be strong to survive the onslaught they suffer from mistrust and degradation, and can be slow to trust and make new friends.

|''Hellish Resistance:'' Resistance to fire damage.|

<pre>[&gt;img[images/bestiary/ruje/torble.jpg]]
Torbles (called &quot;chordoplasms&quot; by scholars of strange fauna and &quot;ooze bugs&quot; by many others) are strange and fascinating creatures native to the continent of [[Ruje]].  These strangely colored creatures resemble a cross between a tiny [[Ooze]] and an insect.  They typically have a bulbous, beetle-like translucent body, six legs, and long eyestalks with primitive sensory knobs on the end.  Usually they take on green, gray, or pink shades; though they may be of any color.  The creature's interior may be clear or cloudy, and has the same consistency and properties of the fluid that surrounds the brains of lower animals.  After the creature feeds, however, its color temporarily changes to match the color of its meal - which sometimes remains visible for hours.  They are roughly the size of a hand, 7 inches long and 5 inches wide, weighing about 1 pound.

!The Vermin Of Ruje
Torbles are scavengers and have found a niche living on the filth of cities and civilization.  They prefer to gravitate to damp locations such as city sewers - and can survive on any scavenged organic material.  Rarely dangerous in small numbers, they prove annoying to civilized society.  Ooze bugs reproduce by creating internal buds that mature and migrate to the creature's outer surface, erupting as inch-long, disgusting transparent things resembling a cross between a slug and a cockroach.  These buds can survive the destruction of the parent for days, feeding off the corpse until they are ready to emerge and fend for themselves;  this means attempts to eradicate an infestation are usually only temporarily effective, as the unborn Torbles quickly grow and repopulate the area inhabited by the now-dead adults.  Only if the bug-slayers deliberately crush the adult corpses or consume them with fire or similar methods can they be certain their efforts are successful in the long term.

Although a Torble has no true organs, it has a stiff bundle of fibrous nerve tissue running the length of its body that helps hold its shape.  When it rests, it retracts its antennae and legs into its body, similar to how a snail or slug withdraws its eyestalks when threatened.

<pre>Traveling is the magic means of creating holes in reality in order to create one-way shortcuts between points in time, space and [[Dimensions]].  A magical gateway can take nearly any shape or color, but are often rectangular in shape (roughly the shape of a doorway).  As long as the gate is large enough, an object or willing being need only step into it to be transported.  Beings with Magic Resistance lower the effective skill of the gate's creator accordingly, possibly preventing the gate from working for them (see p M13).  If an unwilling (or unwitting) person sticks a hand into the gate, removing it can be difficult; roll a Regular Contest between the victim's ST and the caster's effective skill, each turn of effort costing the victim a point of fatigue.  If the victim fails the contest, his only choices are to stay stuck in the gateway or to pass through...

If the gate is not large enough, it will feel like an impenetrable wall.  Gates are impervious to physical attacks and to most magic.  They are also opaque to light and non-particulate radiation in general.  Spells other than Information ones may be cast through a gate,at the usual penalty for casting blindly (unless Scry Gate is used).  An Area spell does not &quot;spill through&quot; an open gate, but matter created by such a spell may.

To tell where a gate leads, without stepping through it, is difficult; a successful Analyze Magic will only reveal the //nature// of the gate: distance, time or universe/plane (or combination).  A critical success will reveal the gate's destination, its opening or closing clauses,m whether several gates share the same spot, etc.  The Scry Gate spell can also be used to gain clues as to a portal's &quot;connection point&quot;.

Gates may be the subject of many spells, but the GM should keep in mind that they are in no way physical objects.  A free standing illusion spell could disguise one, but Illusion Shell could not be used, for example.  Gates //can// be the subject of Invisibility.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/troll.jpg]]
Trolls are a short-lived race of ugly and stupid humanoids.  They live among the [[Orcs|Orc]] as slaves.  They are tall and slender with a green and brown skin covered in pustules.  Their hair is usually long, matted and black, though some trolls have hair color that is mossy green, orange or dull blue.  They have long pointy noses and sharp teeth. Their eyes appear as dark black, empty sockets sunk deep into their skull.  Rarely do trolls wear more than loincloths or vests.

!Psychology
Trolls are easily the stupidest of the major races.  They are not inherently evil, but are often savage and unpredictable.  All civilizations often view them as monsters and animals.  They lack the wisdom and morals of members of more ‘civilized’ races.

Trolls will eat almost any kind of meat, including the flesh of sentient races.  However, they can survive on cattle and pigs or any other more typical food animal.  They are not above cannibalism, some starving and desperate Trolls even eating their OWN flesh (due to their rapid healing abilities). Due to their instinctive fear and vulnerability to fire, Trolls eat their meat uncooked and prefer it fresh.

They have no language of their own and speak the [[Orc]], [[Human]] or a garbled mixture of the two tongues.  Some have not even learned the art of communication, and are effectively mute.  This is not due to any physical limitations, but simply from not learning the basics of speech.  Their names usually only contain one syllable or are meaningless grunts.

They are a very short-lived race, reaching maturity at the age of three.  They are hermaphroditic, having internal sex organs capable of asexual reproduction.  A baby Troll grows on the back of the adult, falling off when it is the approximate size of a 3 year old [[Human]] child.  It is capable of walking and eating solid foods.  It is unknown as to the trigger of this reproduction method, but due to these strange methods Troll populations can grow exponentially.

!Culture
Trolls have no real culture or language of their own.  Trolls are slaves, and considered the property of the [[Orcish Tribes]] that bred them, and are branded at birth with the [[tribe’s symbol|Orcish Tribes]] (to aid in reclaiming property).  Trolls are broken up into the following classes: laborers, servants, soldiers, and overseers.  Laborers work the farms and mines.  Servants are assigned to [[Orc Chieftains|Orc Chieftain]], [[shamans|Orc Shaman]] and high-ranking military officers.  Soldiers fill the ranks of the [[Orc]] army as first strike infantry and foot soldiers.  The overseer class is made up of the well-bred and more intelligent Trolls.  They are responsible for the laborers and soldiers who work among the [[Orc]].  Only overseers are given the right to own property in [[Orc]] society, though they are watched closely.  Other Trolls generally fear and are jealous of the overseers.

The [[ancestors of modern Trolls|Third Age Troll]] were solitary predators.  Once born, a baby Troll was left to fend for itself (an easy task with the natural abilities Trolls possess).  Society and Culture are not instinctive traits of the Trolls, but they do understand freedom, and most despise their current subjugation.  Due to their natural tendency to be loners, Trolls do not understand the concept of ‘banding together’, and therefore will most likely remain enslaved by the more organized [[Orcish race|Orc]].

Due to their short life span, Trolls often lack the finer skills indicative of more refined, or ‘educated’ races.  This makes Trolls appear to be childlike and simple.  Trolls spend little time on art or beauty, and spend what little time they have on this world on skills that can aid in survival or procreation.

!Politics
On occasion, the [[Kombar'Ran|Dwarf]] have experimented with Troll labor forces.  Trolls make excellent workman in the mines due to their strength and natural digging abilities.  However, most of these experiments end in failure.  Often too many [[Kombar'Ran|Dwarf]] lose their lives to an out of control Troll blunder, or the [[Dwarven strongholds|Stronghold]] have become overrun with baby Trolls.

Trolls have no government, but instead are governed by the [[Orc]].  Most other races do not view the Trolls as necessarily ‘evil’.  Their ties to the [[Orc]] is often seen as unfortunate, but they are usually seen as unwilling slaves or servants.  The other races have a disdain for Trolls simply on the grounds that they are usually the cause of extreme damage or trouble.  Even Trolls with good intentions inadvertently find ways of causing a ruckus, since they forget how fragile other races truly are.</pre>

Tromokratis is a [[Primordial]] titan from the [[Elemental Planes|The Fountains Of Creation]] living on [[Asha]].  It can be found at the depths of the ocean near the continent of [[Amon]] in a location known as [[The Sailor's Grave]] within [[The Risen Reef]].  Tromokratis slumbers for long periods, making him a myth and legend.  It requires this sleep in order to retain its tether to [[The Material Plane]], waking only to feed on what passes by its terrible maw.

A True Name is comprised of everything that has gone into a thing's shaping since its creation.  It is the core identity of an entity.  However, comprehending a True Name in its entirety is beyond the grasp of the mortal mind, and thus a True Name can only be perceived by the subconscious &quot;sleeping mind&quot;.

In contrast to a common name, which is merely a label or identifier, a True name represents the metaphysical identity unique to an individual or thing.  A true name is not a name by which one is called or given at birth, but instead a hidden name that rather than just acting as a label, metaphysically truly belonged to that creature.  All beings have a true name, though most of these are unknown, especially to mortals.  

The knowledge of a creature's True Name holds great power, as it grants the possessor authority over that entity.  The discovery of a True Name is achieved through a ritual that unveils the hidden essence of the named being.  Prior to this ritual, even the named individual is unaware of their own True Name. It is important to note that a person can only comprehend and hold the knowledge of a single True Name at a time. If one possesses knowledge of their own True Name, it becomes protected from others, but this also means they forfeit the opportunity to know another True Name. Should a True Name be revealed or used once, it is reset and forgotten, necessitating a new ritual to uncover it again.

[[Eldermancy]], a potent form of [[Wizardry]], harnesses a lesser version of True Naming to create magical effects. By understanding partial aspects of True Names, [[Eldermancers|Wizardry]] manipulate the underlying forces of the universe to weave their enchantments.

The language of [[Truespeech]] serves as the medium for all True Names. Truespeech is the first language of the universe, transcending mundane languages and communicating directly with the essence of beings and the fabric of reality.  Speaking a True Name is no easy feat, as it requires mastery of this ancient and powerful language.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/kellos/the-isles/zylok/tsoofe-vedelem.jpg]]
Tsoofe Vedelem (c. 1002 [[AAP]] to Current) was a player character run by [[Maika Danford]].

Tsoofe was born on the streets of [[Zylok]] to a poor [[Tiefling]] mother named [[Sabarra]].  The exact time and location are unknown, as her early years were spent moving from place to place within the city.  She does not know who her father was, and her only family was the mother from which she styled herself after.  Unfortunately, [[Sabarra]] passed away when Tsoofe was young, leaving only the button from her cloak behind.

!The Streets Of Zylok
The streets of Zylok were harsh for a young [[Tiefling]], and an older beggar took her under his wing until she learned to navigate on her own.  Tsoofe later did the same for other urchins when she was older, nicknaming her motley gang [[&quot;The Tsooflings&quot;|The Tsooflings]].  Growing up on the streets taught Tsoofe to look out for herself, and she was not above petty theft and other minor crimes.  It was in the year 1020 [[AAP]] that Tsoofe was caught by [[Alastair Neron]], performing simple [[Cantrips|Wizardry]] to steal food.  Impressed with her knowledge and resilience, he gave Tsoofe the choice of jail or enrolling in [[The Athenaeum]]; a school for [[Wizardry]].  Despite despising the rich and pretentious students at the school, she reluctantly agreed.

!The Difficult Student
Tsoofe was very cautious and distrusting of the new people and situations in school, and would mask her wariness and fear by being aggressive and combative.  However, she warmed up quickly to the two other students in her advisory: [[Alana Underwood]] and [[Ulan Nailo]].  Tsoofe could intuitively sense they were both masking their own uneasiness, which made her feel less alone.  Some [[Wizardry]] came easy to Tsoofe, but others hard - she struggled so hard to make her first wand, and never truly perfected it.  When she wasn't studying [[Illusions|Illusion]], she was exploring [[The Athenaeum]] and getting into enough hijinks that she and her friends named themselves [[The Troublemakers]].
They released a [[Dathairä]] in the basement, visited [[The Restricted Section Of The Athenaeum Library]] multiple times, and entered [[The Feywild]] through [[The Mirror Of Resplendence]] hidden by the founders of the school.  When [[The Athenaeum]] was under attack during [[The Black Night]] of 1025 [[AAP]], [[The Troublemakers]] rose to the occasion to assist.

!The Spire Of Planes
With the school closed after the events of [[The Black Night]], [[The Troublemakers]] went on a mission to find the missing pieces of [[The Spire Of Planes]] to stop [[The Whispered One]] from rising again.  They traveled the world and across dimensions to complete this mission.  During these adventures, Tsoofe became disillusioned (pun intended) with [[Wizardry]] and began feeling a stronger connection to [[The Gods]].  She became a self-taught [[Cleric]], and began to follow the ways of [[Lucian]] after finding a holy symbol of [[The Sovereign Host]].

!The Last Shieldbearer
In the city of [[Palma Flora]], it was Tsoofe who became the shield bearer of [[The Shield Of The Hidden Lord]].  A sentient shield containing the [[Dathairä]] [[Vaecna]], Tsoofe convinced [[The Troublemakers]] (now with a [[Tabaxi]] warrior named [[Juro Allast]]) to travel to [[Baator]].  Once there, Tsoofe was able to protect all of her friends (but not herself) each night from [[Corruption]].  She traded [[The Shield|The Shield Of The Hidden Lord]] to the [[Hag]] [[Mad Maggie]] in return for information on how to defeat [[The Whispered One]].  Despite [[Vaecna]] telepathically speaking terrible ideas into her head while wielding it, Tsoofe enjoyed the power and protection an artifact like that granted her.

!Tsoofe The Savior
While collecting the final piece of [[The Spire Of Planes]], [[The Troublemakers]] fought the ancient red [[Dragon]] [[Aglanore]] on the continent of [[Uskard]].  Soon before the killing blow was made against [[Aglanore]], the [[Dragon]] killed [[Alana Underwood]] with its fiery breath.  Mustering all of her faith, Tsoofe [[Resurrected|Resurrection]] her; proving to herself that she was a worthy [[Cleric]].  During the final battle against [[The Whispered One]], Tsoofe was prepared to sacrifice herself with [[The Spire Of Planes]] to rid the world of evil.  As she healed her friends and prepared herself to die; [[Ulan Nailo]] completed [[The Ritual Of Seeding]] negating the need.

!Tsoofe The Lady Of House Vedelem
Having saved [[Asha]], [[Emperor]] [[Galad Jedaleon]] granted Tsoofe nobility and the last name [[Vedelem|House Vedelem]].  She then went on to help the poor of [[Zylok]] with her new wealth and influence.  She married [[Juro Allast]], and the two adventure together.

[[Tsoofe's Familiar|Tsoofe Vedelem's Familiar]] came to her as a dwarf owl she named [[Bieke]].</pre>

!Description
Tszanthus, also known as The Crown Of [[The Moonsea]], is one of the cities located in [[Ruje]] that comprise [[The Freeholds|The Hegemony]] of [[The Hegemony]].  Straddled across the river known as [[The Rhill]], the city has a long and storied history, being founded as a stronghold for an [[Oeridian Warlord|The Oeridian Kingdoms]] in [[The Third Age]].  It later grew into a city, with endless cycles of destruction and determined rebuilding which saw Tszanthus grow more resilient and formidable.  The city has seen many occupiers throughout it's existence, with influences from multiple cultures throughout the region.

Tszanthus is an ancient city, and is perched on top of one vast archeological site.  The modern city sits on top of the detritus of its predecessor cities, arching back into time over three millennia.  Many cellars are the foundations of ancient buildings, some only a stone wall separating them from an underground labyrinth that is a hidden city of spectacular ancient remains, frigid waters, peculiar animals, and powerful odors.  Explorers will find abandoned theaters, baths, stadium, villas, and temples; as Tszanthian architects frequently tore the roofs from old buildings and filled their interiors with dirt to make solid foundations for new structures.  When dirt was unavailable, they entombed earlier buildings in tremendous landfills that raised the ground level of the entire city by several yards.

In 1026 [[AAP]] or [[Hassomir]] 1268, an event known as [[The Weeping]] struck the city.  Over 20,000 individuals suddenly died as their [[Soul]] was ripped from their body.  While the city was perplexed as to the cause, only a few understand this event was due to [[Rithseril]] resetting the malfunctioning [[Reliquary]] deep in [[The Undercity]] that was improperly causing [[Elven|Elf]] [[Souls|Soul]] to be placed in [[Humans|Human]]; as well as multiple [[Souls|Soul]] to be placed within a single individual causing madness.

!Economy
Because of its excellent location on [[The Moonsea]], Tszanthus has a thriving shipping economy.  The city is speckled with numerous warehouses and docks.  The center of the majority of the trading occurs in [[The Trivardum]] of [[The Lower Streap]], a large, slate-shingled building that acts as the heartbeat of merchant activity within the city.  Merchants from all wards of the city attend to the market each week in order to buy goods that they resell.

Tszanthus is nearly equidistant from each of [[The Freeholds Of The Hegemony|The Hegemony]], making it a central hub for trade and communication.  The bustling city of Tszanthis is known for its exotic markets, towering buildings, and vibrant culture.

!The Undercity
While most are happy to leave [[The Undercity]] out of their thoughts.  If one can find an entrance to it, they would find a treacherous maze that is no easy feat to navigate.  There are very few public entrances, the oldest and most prominent being inside the feasthall known as [[The Delver's Well]].

//My ideal character is a one-legged Kenku Kraken Priest with asthma. ''- Tyler Disbrow''//
}}}

Tyler Disbrow, Conqueror of [[Baator]], Lord of the ancient tomes, and Rule Master is the son of [[Brian Disbrow]] and has been venturing in the world of [[Asha]] since before he could read. At night, he would steal up to his room and read role playing books by the light of the moon; and knows the rules even more than [[his father|Brian Disbrow]].  Typically he can be found fantasizing over new ideas to be added to the [[Asha]] wiki, or talking to his friends about the exciting tales of unique adventures that he has had across [[Asha's|Asha]] vast landscape. Tyler is known to play characters outside the usual demographic of the region the campaign takes place in, an [[Orc]] far in the north, an aristocrat deep in the filth of the slums. 

Tyler doesn't have an obvious specialization, he can be found critiquing new articles, or perusing imperfect pages searching for the truth. Similar to [[his sister|Elizabeth Disbrow]], he is vocal in expressing his opinions about the shape, breadth and scope of [[Asha]] with [[his father|Brian Disbrow]], improving each other's creativity with new conclusions that have been born of mixed ideas.

!Notable Characters
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-stone-lands/brand/erik-doorhaus-portrait.jpg][Erik Doorhaus]] &lt;br&gt; [[Erik Doorhaus]] |__[[Erik Doorhaus]]__ wasn't Tyler's first character, but it was the first that he played when he fully understood how to 'become' the character.  While Tyler was still just a young boy, [[Erik|Erik Doorhaus]] was created to be a lot like Tyler; smart, resourceful, creative, exceptionally talented, and someone who cares deeply about his family.  During [[The Grey Companions]] campaign, tears were shed, and triumph was achieved. |
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-isles/zylok/the-athenaeum/ulan-nailo-portrait.jpg][Ulan Nailo]] &lt;br&gt; [[Ulan Nailo]] |__[[Ulan Nailo]]__ was created when Tyler was in High School, and showcases his developing tendency to play characters who are very complex.  [[Ulan|Ulan Nailo]] was a crippled librarian who sold his soul to a [[Dathairä]] for a new body, causing him to be reborn as a young [[Half-Elf]] boy. Tyler isn't afraid of playing characters who start with a unique disadvantage or looming backstory which may impact him later in the campaign.  In fact, he loves the challenge. |
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-northlands/staz-amrius-kafanz-portrait.jpg][Staz Amrius Kafanz]] &lt;br&gt;[[Staz Amrius Kafanz]] |__[[Staz Amrius Kafanz]]__  was not only the first [[Orc]] player character ever to grace the world of [[Asha]], but Tyler's first character to reach level 20.  In this campaign, Tyler worked to flip his playing style upside down; choosing a strong patient stoic warrior over a brash young magic user which was the template of his last two characters.  [[Staz|Staz Amrius Kafanz]] redefined what it means to be an [[Orc]], explored the concept of racism in [[Asha]], and allowed Tyler to express his own internal philosophies on justice and morality. Tyler found his voice with [[Staz Amrius Kafanz|Staz]] and helped Tyler bring back his confidence and love of the game. |
| [img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/azarad-portrait.jpg][Azarad]] &lt;br&gt; [[Azarad]] |__[[Azarad]]__ was the first [[Artificer]] in [[Asha]], even requiring the class to be created just for Tyler.  In the beginning, both Tyler and [[Brian Disbrow]] were skeptical that [[Artifice]] would cheapen [[Asha]]; however it fit rather seamlessly into the world once they were through with it.  [[Azarad]] was another unique and challenging character, where Tyler wished to start terminally ill and with one of the lowest Constitution scores possible.  This wasn't to min/max a character so much as to create a flavored backstory which later grew to be instrumental to the campaign. This made it possible for Tyler to achieve the impressive feat of actually rolling a -2, another first in [[Asha]] history.  |
| [img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/rithseril-portrait.jpg][Rithseril]]  [[Rithseril]] |__[[Rithseril]]__ (&quot;Flowing Star&quot;) was actually a second character Tyler played/made within the same campaign where he was [[Azarad]].  In a shocking reveal, Tyler as a player made a decision for his character to not continue with the party/adventure - as he needed to get to the bottom of his illness and saw a means to do so.  In a legendary bit of roleplaying, and to the shock of the other players (and [[Brian|Brian Disbrow]] as the DM) - Tyler ended the session without a character sheet and quickly worked with [[Brian|Brian Disbrow]] to create [[Rithseril]] who in many ways was the opposite of [[Azarad]].

''-[[Serapheal]], writing on Tyreal''
}}}

Tyreal is an [[Archangel]], one of [[The Seven]] that watch over [[Elysium]]. Lucian gifted her [[Althidion]], [[The Spear Of Valor|Althidion]] for her bravery shown upon [[The Night Of Tears]].  She can recall it to her hand with a mere thought.  Tyreal is the current leader of [[The Seven]] due to [[Shalekasha's|Shalekasha]] absence.  She is a mighty warrior, and commander of [[The Radiant Guard]].  She is considered one of the most capable fighters among the [[AstraKashira]]; hero of countless battles in [[The Eternal Conflict]].

!An Undying Rage
Tyreal has led [[The Radiant Guard]] to numerous victories over the forces of [[Azarad-Ji]], but her rage has often gotten the better of her; which ultimately costs her.  She has slayed scores of [[Dathairä]], including the general [[Brazelus]] during [[The Battle Of Fallen Angels]].  This was the final battle upon the soil of [[Limbo]], where countless died in pursuit of Tyreal's rage.  It was during this conflict that Tyreal returned with the head of [[Brazelus]] and one of the severed horns of [[Azarad-Ji]].  Her tactical brilliance encompass all facets of warfare, from maneuvering armies on the battlefield to leading covert strikes.  It is when Tyreal ignores her wisdom and acts on instinct that she puts her army in danger.

!Selfless And Capable Warrior
Tyreal embodies all that the [[AstraKashira]] are renowned for; she is selfless, brave, noble, loyal and dedicated to the mission of [[Elysium]].  The mere sight of her emboldens [[The Radiant Guard]] in battle.  She has demonstrated the ability to resist the powers of fear even where other [[AstraKashira]] have failed.  Sadly, the fall of [[Shalekasha]] inflicted deep psychological scars on Tyreal, traumatizing her greatly.  She now knows her own stubbornness and rage (while boiled over anew at [[Shalekasha's|Shalekasha]] deceit) could be her own undoing and path into darkness.  One that she just might be willing to trade for everlasting peace.

!Leader Of The Seven
With [[Shalekasha]] gone, the rule of [[The Seven]] has fallen to Tyreal.  She leads the only way she known, like a military commander; which can ruffle the feathers of some of her compatriots.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/kellos/the-isles/zylok/the-athenaeum/ulan-nailo.jpg]]
Ulan Nailo was a player character run by [[Tyler Disbrow]]

Ulan Nailo was originally born a [[Human]] in 978 [[AAP]], and was adopted by [[Mathius Vespian]] (Book Warden of [[The Athenaeum]]) as a baby.  [[Mathius|Mathius Vespian]] is tight lipped about the means he came upon a baby, and many rumors abound as to the origin.  It was [[Winterscrest]] when he returned with the child.  He named him [[Gydas|Gydas Vespian]] after a [[Kellish|Kell]] folk-tale of a [[warrior king|Gydas Addonia]] who is celebrated during [[Winterscrest]].  As [[Gydas|Gydas Vespian]] grew, it became obvious that he had little talent for [[Magic]] and possessed no physicality for athletics.  He was clumsy and oafish due to a twisted spine that caused him to walk with a limped hunch.  Since activity was difficult for him, [[Gydas|Gydas Vespian]] took to the books in the library he grew up in.  At a young age he helped [[Mathius Vespian]] maintain the library of [[The Athenaeum]] and soon took on the role of [[Keeper Of The Books]].  He served in this role for over 30 years, and his envy for the [[Wizard|Wizardry]] students continued to grow.  At the age of 43 in the year 1021 [[AAP]], [[Gydas|Gydas Vespian]] ventured into [[The Restricted Section Of The Athenaeum Library]].  There he poured through ancient tomes of power, and stumbled upon a book of rituals.  Inadvertently summoning an [[Imp]] in the service of [[Belphagor]], he found himself being beguiled into a contract that granted him a new body and new lease on life at the cost of releasing a [[Dathairä]] trapped under the school.

Transformed into a youthful [[Half-Elf]], he took the name Ulan Nailo and enrolled as a student in [[The Athenaeum]] in 1021 [[AAP]].  He chose this name as it came to him when he awoke within the new body; whether it was fate or his own concoction he may never know.  In school, he met [[Alana Underwood]] and [[Tsoofe Vedelem]]; fellow students within the same Advisory group under [[Professor]] [[Thog Stoneheart]].

Ulan is fascinated by literature.  He is skilled at research and has learned spellcraft that allows him to read more efficiently.  Ulan enjoys learning, and seeks knowledge no matter how dangerous.  His current obsession is knowledge of [[The First Age]].  He believes there is lost knowledge that could better society as a whole.  While working at [[The Athenaeum]], he had the privilege of handling and repairing books of all kinds and values. But nothing prepared him for the discovery of a notebook that belonged to an ancient and powerful [[Wizard]], hidden behind a dusty bookshelf for centuries.  The notebook spoke on the art of [[Jamming]] (a means of shifting ones consciousness to another point in time).  Ulan recognized this lost notebook as both dangerous and reckless, even though the owner never completed the forbidden research.  While traversing [[Asha]], Ulan would discretely seek out more knowledge of [[Jamming]] - only to be misinterpreted as seeking Jam recipes.

Many believe Ulan to be naive, however he is simply more generous than all others; he has been known to give everything he owns to those he believes need it more than him.

While on a field trip with [[Professor]] [[Barnabus Diggle]] in [[The Boneyard]], he stumbled upon a [[Hag]] whom he bargained with.  He traded a piece of his luck for an ancient and powerful artifact known as [[The Dawn Shroud]].  Since then, Ulan has found that he has been lessened in some way; and switched his major to [[Divination]] to not only help unlock the secret of [[The First Age]], but to uncover what it was he lost.  Most are drawn to [[Divination]] for a desire to see the future, Ulan seeks to learn about the hidden past.

[[Ulan's Familiar|Ulan Nailo's Familiar]] came to him as a black cat that he named [[Pearl|Ulan Nailo's Familiar]].  While many [[Wizards|Wizardry]] like to keep their [[Familiar]] in the form it arrived (as it prefers this state), Ulan is not one to shy away from transforming [[Pearl|Ulan Nailo's Familiar]] into many forms.</pre>

Umberlee, also known as The Heartless Queen, The Drowned God, The Queen Of The Deep or The Dweller is an entity worshiped by some as a [[God|The Gods]].  Her worshipers are unorganized and scattered, holding no temples or hierarchy.  Each have been touched by her in some form, referring to themselves as [[The Drowned]].

Her seldomly seen avatar is that of a giant woman with a body colored like the sea, of blues and greens.  Her hands are talons, her elbows have fins, and her green hair is made of kelp.  Her white eyes sparkle white like pearls, and her voice sounds like the fiercest sea storm, booming with breaking waves.  She takes pleasure in her form scaring and impressing mortals into her service; laughing with malicious glee as she toys with them.

She is a [[Seraph]], a spirit who is as capricious and cruel as she is calm and pacifying.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/magic/umbramancy.jpg]]
Umbramancy is a unique and secretive style of [[Magic]] practiced by the [[Draugaira]] [[Elves|Elf]].  It is a complex blend of dark [[Blood Magic]], [[Sorcery]] and traditional [[Wizardry]] used to bond [[Souls|Soul]] to physical items.  The practice of Umbramancy is not well understood by those outside of the [[Draugaira]], as the [[Elves|Elf]] are notoriously private about their [[Magic]] and traditions.

!Soul Magic
At its core, Umbramancy is a form of soul-binding [[Magic]].  The [[Draugaira]] can bind a [[Soul]] to a physical object, imbuing the object with power and purpose.  This is accomplished through a complex ritual that involves the sacrifice of blood and the manipulation of arcane energies.  Once the [[Soul]] is bound to the object, it can be used to perform a wide range of magical feats.

The process of soul-binding is a delicate and dangerous one, and it requires a great deal of skill and precision to perform correctly. The [[Draugaira]] are very selective about who they allow to practice Umbramancy, and only those who have proven themselves to be trustworthy and responsible are permitted to learn this powerful magic.

!Sentient Objects
One of the key aspects of Umbramancy is the ability to create powerful and sentient magical items. These items are imbued with a portion of the [[Soul]] of their creator, or willing participant. Some Umbramancers create weapons that are particularly effective against certain types of enemies, while others create magical artifacts that are used to protect their communities or perform specific tasks.

The use of [[Blood Magic]] in Umbramancy has led some to view it as a dark and dangerous form of magic. However, the [[Draugaira]] see it as a necessary and important part of their culture and tradition. They believe that the power of the [[Soul]] is sacred, and that it should be used to protect and benefit their community.</pre>

Umwe is one of [[The Elder Gods]]; and is the mightiest and the first of the [[Elysians|Elysian]]; and one of [[The Gods]] of [[Asha]].  He created children known as [[The Elysians|Elysian]].  He existed in [[void and nothingness|The Void]], and coalesced and stored his power in what we refer to as [[The Astral Stream]].  It was here that he created a place to form [[his children|The Gods]] to assist him in filling his domain with song, art and dance.  Umwe designed the theme by which all of his children's creations would abide, that is until [[Valouria]] entered his domain.

[[Valouria]] was not of Umwe's creation, yet with time grew to be one he held in high regard.  After a time, Umwe came to understand [[Valouria]] gave birth to her own child in the form of the vile [[Azarad-Ji]].  A heavenly battle ensued, ending with Umwe losing his eyesight and suffering a grave injury.  His children imprisoned [[Azarad-Ji]], but since the battle Umwe has closed his eyes and remained silent.

!Umwe's Children
The first of Umwe's children was [[Qualok]].  Umwe formed [[Qualok]] from the air of [[The Fountains Of Creation]], imbued with some of Umwe's own power.  [[Qualok]] was an adept child, and Umwe was pleased.  Umwe created his three other children, [[Xander]] from the strength of elemental fire, [[Kombar]] from the endurance of earth, and [[Lucian]] from tranquil and formless water.  Each opened their eyes in unison, joining the chorus with Umwe and [[Qualok]].</pre>

{{quote{
//&quot;I was moved to tears at the mere sight of my first Unicorn, and I've met the [[Archfey]].&quot;//
''-[[Naurase]]''
}}}
Unicorns are native to [[The Feywild]], a plane of [[Magic]] and wonder.  They are guardians and protectors of the realm, and revered by the [[Fey]] as holy messengers and divine emissaries from [[Valouria]] herself.  Simply beholding one can evoke fear or awe in an observer, or be celebrated far and wide as a harbinger of destiny and good fortune.  Seeing a Unicorn is a blessing, and events that happen on such a day are especially auspicious.  Unicorns resemble horses with a horn on their brow wrought in gleaming light.  In a breeze, the creature's mane and tail create the impression that the Unicorn is ablaze with a holy, golden fire.  They are noble, magnificent and wise, but can be terrifying if provoked.  One horn is most common, but a Unicorn of fierce demeanor might have two horns or a set of antlers like those of a great stag.  They can appear as different sizes to different people, although they themself never change. 

!Connected To Valouria - Gods Of The Feywild
All unicorns are imbued with a fragment of [[Valouria's|Valouria]] power, granting them a deep connection to [[The Echo Planes]].  After claiming a domain, they remain solitary creatures that constantly roam, moving ever so carefully so as not to disturb the other denizens.  It is said that their connection to their domain is so deep that nothing occurs within it that escapes their notice.  They are aware of every insect spinning its cocoon, every leaf a bright butterfly rests its tired wings, and every tune sung by [[The Fair Folk]] of the region.  In a Unicorn's domain, a sense of calm pervades; all creatures (both predator and prey) gain vigor as they evolve towards an idealized form.  Such creatures are rarely aggressive when under a Unicorn's protection.  Even the mercurial [[Shy Folk|The Shy Folk]] loyally serve the Unicorn.

!Teachers and Mentors
The power of the Unicorns is undeniable, and they are easily the most powerful creatures within [[The Feywild]].  While many desire their wisdom, they rarely interfere or solve the problems of the inhabitants of [[The Feywild]] or [[The Court Of Stars]]; while they have empathy in the plight of the creatures of [[The Feywild]], they understand that strife is often necessary to teach important lessons.  Unicorns can speak all languages native to [[The Feywild]], and can manipulate, transport, heal and manifest themselves into different shapes to aid in communication.

<div title="Uskard" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202108011349" modified="202307311501" tags="continent" changecount="40">
<pre>Uskard is one of the six known continents of [[Asha]], located in the southern hemisphere.  It is the area ruled by [[The Nissido Dynasty]].  Uskard was once described as a bright and beautiful jewel, but the landscape suffered much in the cataclysm known as [[The Destruction Of Uskard]] in 29 [[IO]].  This event is known to the [[Uskardeen]] as &quot;The Mourning&quot;.

!Geography
The continent of Uskard is a massive landmass connected to [[Bazrakia]] to the south west beyond [[Miljana's Teeth]].  Areas of the land remain blighted by [[The Destruction Of Uskard]], where life struggles to persist.  These areas are called [[The Mournlands]] and avoided at great peril for the haunting [[Souls|Soul]] that still roam there.

!Culture
[[The Nissido Dynasty]] retains tight control over the culture of Uskard.  All [[Tieflings|Tiefling]] are outlawed and detained, captured or killed by [[The Bezimen]]; the soldiers of [[The Dynasty|The Nissido Dynasty]] who are feared by the populace for their strictness and lack of mercy.  They hide their faces behind golden masks of demonic and angelic faces.  Those who follow the law have no fear, but those who step our of line are punished mercilessly.

!Government
[[The Nissido Dynasty]] was officially founded in 9 [[IO]] when [[Shihab Nissido]] proclaimed himself ruler and adopted the title of &quot;[[Chitan]]&quot;.  The [[Dynasty|The Nissido Dynasty]] is mysterious, with the [[Chitan]] having absolute power.  The highest tier of [[Uskardeen]] society is held by those who are of [[The Blood]].  Initially, this was a privilege granted only to the descendants of [[Shihab Nissido]], but over time others have been raised to the title.  Being given entry into [[The Blood]], while exceptionally rare, is the greatest honor possible for one who is born a commoner.
The local populace celebrate [[The Festival Of Balance]], where the townsfolk generously pool small portions of their life force in order to heal the sick and elderly.  It is a celebration of life, and the power amassed from within each and every individual.

!The Zmejskala Sovereignty
Prior to [[The Destruction Of Uskard]], the government was a collection of hundreds of local rulers who collectively referred to themselves as [[The Zmejskala Sovereignty]].  Each region was governed uniquely by their own [[Kralot]], with no central management or ruler; with laws, practices and traditions unique to the local people. Knitting [[The Sovereignty|The Zmejskala Sovereignty]] together was [[The Way]], a philosophy and religious belief that guided and shaped their society.  It was princess [[Vesna Zeuxis]], gifted with [[Foretelling]], who foresaw [[The Destruction Of Uskard]] and escaped to [[Kellos]] with a contingent of [[Uskardeen]] followers.

!The Way
The city of [[Jakah]] is considered the cradle of [[The Way]], understood by its practitioners as the place where the religion flourishes.  [[The Palace Of The Way]] is the oldest known temple in [[Asha]], built here in [[Jakah]] during [[The Second Age]]; a time of strife and cataclysm.  It is common for practitioners to pilgrimage here.

!Ancient History
Predating the earliest records of [[The Zmejskala Sovereignty]] is evidence of a vast civilization and culture that predates modern reckoning.  The culture is known simply as [[The Theselian People]], whose language ([[Uskamali]]) was used well into [[The Sovereignty|The Zmejskala Sovereignty]] and forms the base of modern day [[Uskaran]].  Not much is known of [[The Theselian People]], but evidence of their civilization can be found in carvings and ruins.

!Known Locations
* [[Hamrama]] - This city houses the [[Magija]] or &quot;Spellhold&quot;, the nerve center of [[The Cowled Wizards]]
* [[Jakah]] - The city houses the oldest temple of [[The Way]], and sacred to the [[Uskardeen]], and home to many [[Souk]] merchants
* [[The Temno Mountains]] - are a mountain chain on the north end of the continent, it boasts an active volcano known as [[Mount Zgura]]
* [[The Mournlands]] - are an area of blighted land left over from [[The Destruction Of Uskard]] 
* [[Miljana's Teeth]] - are a mountain range to the south, separating [[Bazrakia]] from Uskard
* [[Khurdilan]] - a port city on the western coast of [[Uskard]]</pre>

The Uskardeen are a race of [[Humans|Human]] that settled and thrived in the civilization of [[Uskard]].

<pre>[&gt;img[images/darkones/vaecna.jpg]]

Vaecna was a [[Dathairä]] that served as a veteran in [[Azarad-Ji's|Azarad-Ji]] army.  Upon being awoken in [[The Second Age]], he fought again for his master.  When [[The Divine Gate]] was sealed, Vaecna grew bored.  While his kin were content to fight for position and control of [[Baator]], Vaecna set his sights on [[Asha]].  He was the first to recognize that the foolish [[Humans|Human]] were the catalyst that freed him and his kind from their prison - and could potentially be used to do it again.

In [[The Third Age]] he was entertained by the fleeting mortality of [[Humans|Human]].  Unlike the other animals of the planet, these [[Human]] organisms spread like a disease across [[Asha]] - felling forests, stripping minerals, and destroying each other.  They had a hunger for power, yet no connection or understanding to [[The Eternal Cycle]].  No other [[Dathairä]] paid them any mind, however Vaecna toyed with them, taking pleasure in their ignorance.  He dissected them, studied them, lived among them, and made a science of understanding their pain.

His final plaything was [[Ammenon]], a [[Human]] slave filled with two of Vaecna's favorite ingredients: rage and desperation.  This victim desired revenge, and Vaecna delivered.  Vaecna was convinced that he could use [[Ammenon]] to bring about [[Desecration]], earning him favor with [[Azarad-Ji]].  He continued to corrupt [[Ammenon]], and provide him with more power as the darkness grew within him.

[[Ammenon]] continued to prove himself to be a potential source for [[Desecration]], as he took to [[Blood Magic]] naturally.  Unbeknownst to Vaecna, [[Ammenon]] twisted and developed new forms of rituals that suited his needs.  It was these magics that [[Ammenon]] used to trap Vaecna.  It was at this moment the [[Dathairä]] first felt fear, as he was clearly outwitted and outmatched by a mortal.  Now Vaecna was the toy, as [[Ammenon]] used the training that Vaecna provided to dissect, study, and torment him - until he finished by butchering Vaecna for parts.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/the-feywild/archfey/vanwa-heru.jpg]]

VanwaHeru (in [[Elvish]] &quot;The Forgotten Prince&quot;) is an [[Archfey]] from [[The Feywild]] who was long ago imprisoned by what is now known as [[The Court Of Stars]].  His acts were so vile that his captors erased their own memory of him, his deeds, and his location - offering him no hope for being found.  Although VanwaHeru himself is not aware of his whereabouts, he has complete control over his apparently malleable world and alters its appearance into a richly appointed suite.  He has lost track of time, and finds his solitude maddening.  He is powerful, but in an effortless way.  He is vain, but generous; cruel, but helpful.  He will do anything to get what he desires; even subordinate himself to mortals.

Unbeknownst to VanwaHeru, he is trapped within a pocket of [[Sene'Rine'Rada]], the dream world.  On rare occasion, he has noticed a flaw in his prison - brief glimpses of beings who have obliviously stumbled into his domain due to their careless dreaming.  He desperately attempts to ensnare these travelers, and take advantage of their confusion with his charm.  Unfortunately, many of these dreamers fade quickly and slip through his grasp.  Those he is able to communicate with, he is able to gift power - allowing them to return.  He is a [[Warlock Patron]] that seduces with power, reminding his charges that he is their loyal servant; even though he holds all of the power.

Loyalty means everything to VanwaHeru, for he was once betrayed - and seeks to return to [[The Feywild]] and once again claim his throne as the ruler of [[The Court Of Stars]].  He prides himself that he is incapable of lying, and is truthful when he claims to be serving those he gives power; as long as it serves his purposes.

While memories in [[The Feywild]] have been erased, VanwaHeru's have not.  He remembers clearly being overthrown by his subjects, and their lack of loyalty.  [[Lady Calacira]] ruled [[The Dawn Court]] and was the [[Archfey]] who held most of his ire.  It was her who organized his subjects against him, and he took delight in killing her - an act never been done in [[The Feywild]] before.  While his name has been forgotten, he remembers it clearly; and he waits for the day he can return to [[The Feywild]] and give the denizens there a reason to remember his true name: [[SenaCethu]] (&quot;The Silver Star&quot; in [[Elvish]]).

!Fated
VanwaHeru is [[Fated]] to the [[Fey]] [[Hag]] [[Babaroga]], and he adores everything about her - so much that he freely gave her his [[Heart|The Heart Of VanwaHeru]].  As his [[Fated]], her destiny was intertwined with his, and she was expected to rule alongside of him as his equal.  [[Babaroga]] ignored this compulsion, preferring instead to rule from the shadows.  While she denied her rightful title of power, she admired him and found his presence comforting.  She whispered wicked thoughts of power and coercion to influence his plans.  [[Babaroga]], wishing to be free from the [[Fey]] debt of [[VanwaHeru's Gifted Heart|The Heart Of VanwaHeru]] knew she had to give an equal value gift back.  Unwilling to give her own love, she created a legion of [[Hags|Hag]], beautiful [[Fey]] [[sorceress|Sorcery]], for him to command.  After the fall of [[The Court Of Stars]], [[Babaroga]], wishing to be free from [[VanwaHeru]], crafted [[The House Of Black Lanterns]] with [[The Heart Of VanwaHeru]] and then promptly traded it.

!The Quicksilver Program
[[Babaroga]] told VanwaHeru of her vision that a more powerful [[Archfey]] not of [[The Feywilds|The Feywild]] would one day usurp [[The Court Of Stars]].  In response to this, VanwaHeru directed his legion of [[Hags|Hag]] to initiate [[The Quicksilver Program]].  While many assumed his intent was to create a weapon so powerful and so cunning that it would cement his rule of [[The Feywild]] for eternity; in reality he sought to create the very being who would usurp him.  He wished to raise his usurper with love, and willingly step down and spend an eternity with his love [[Babaroga]].  This breeding program corrupted and manipulated mortals, and culminated into the birth of [[Naurase]] who he adopted as his own daughter, to the horror of the other [[Archfey]] and [[Babaroga]].</pre>

<pre>|![[Guide To Roleplaying A Variona'Sha]]|

The Variona’Sha (rough translation: Sacred Guards who Atone) are a nomadic race of honorable, warrior [[Elves|Elf]] who descend from the legendary group of warriors known as the [[Varigellë]] (translation: Honor the Holy One) who guarded the [[Forana'loloKashira]] during their flight from [[The Sylvan Empire]] in [[The Third Age]].  The Variona’Sha never wavered from the tradition their ancestors began with their vigil over their [[forest brothers|Forana'loloKashira]].  Though time has passed and [[The Eternal Cycle]] flows, the Variona'Sha continue keeping the [[Varigellë Code Of Honor]] as their highest law and central tenant.

They are talll, slender humanoids (determine height normally and add 3”). They grow hair only on their heads, and wear their hair long, sometimes braided.  Variona’Sha have a skin tone that ranges from metallic bronze to a shiny gold, which earns them the nickname ‘Bronze Elves’.  Most Variona’Sha decorate their bodies with piercing (ears, nose, and navels).  They are also fond of tattoos, decorative headbands, and other hair ornaments.  Sometimes they even dye their hair to match their [[clan|Variona'Sha Clans]] colors. Clothing is usually made of leathers and cloth, displaying symbols of their [[clan|Variona'Sha Clans]].

!War Wrought and Battle Tested
The Variona’Sha are drastically opposite of their forest dwelling kin the [[Forana'loloKashira]].  Where the [[Wood Elves|Forana'loloKashira]] are gentle and peaceful, the Variona’Sha are savage and warlike.  Their forest cousins have no real law and live only to love.  The Variona’Sha have strict [[codes of honor and conduct|Varigellë Code Of Honor]]. Throughout [[human history|Timeline]], many great stories have been told about the Bronze Elves and their noble deeds, the heroes who triumphed over evil.  They are skilled fighters, like their [[Varigellë]] ancestors - and many still use weapons from [[The Sylvan Empire]] such as the [[Kahedafa]] &quot;dancing sword&quot; and the [[Naginata]].  Two fighting styles unique to the Variona'Sha are [[Shao'loloSikili]] &quot;The Way Of The Knife&quot;, and [[Kaethu]] &quot;Water Dancing&quot;.

!Selfless Defenders
The culture of the Variona’Sha has been defined by a war-wrought history dating back to the [[The Third Age]] and the fall of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  Their origin began with a group of [[Elven|Third Age Elves]] warriors who called themselves the [[Varigellë]].  They were an elite fighting order of men and women who were known to all as the greatest defenders of the ancient empire.  It was the [[Varigellë]] who rallied against the [[corrupted Sylvan Lords|Kiraga]], challenging their law and defending the followers of [[Raime Wesewierë]].  When the true vileness of the [[Kiragä|Kiraga]] was revealed, the [[Varigellë]] fought a battle that lasted through [[The Third Desecration]] and a century beyond.  For years they fought with the [[Kiragä|Kiraga]] and their endless hordes of monsters, thereby giving the [[Elves|Elf]] that heeded the prophecies of [[Raime Wesewierë]] a chance to flee the cities.

!Restless Wanderers
When the [[Kiragä|Kiraga]] had been forced into hiding and the [[Orc]] pushed back into [[Orcish Lands]], many thousands were dead.  But those [[Varigellë]] that survived had no kingdom to return to.  Some did go to the [[Havens]] and joined the [[Elves|Third Age Elves]] that became the [[Forana'loloKashira]].  However, most found no comfort in the carefree woodland dwellings, finding that war was all they remembered.  The restless ones gathered together in the plains and formed the first [[clan|Variona'Sha Clans]] of the Variona’Sha (roughly translating to ‘Sacred Guards’).  This [[clan|Variona'Sha Clans]] grew and continued keeping the [[Varigellë Code Of Honor]] as their highest law.  The clan split and their culture spread throughout the realm.

!The Clan Above All Else
The Variona’Sha live in groups they refer to as [[clans|Variona'Sha Clans]].  Each clan has an animal totem that they revere as sacred.  Each clan has a [[Chief|Variona'Sha Chief]] and a [[Shaman|Variona'Sha Shaman]].  Shaman’s are sacred and honored within Variona’Sha culture, and are practitioners of [[Druidic|Druid]] [[Primal Magic]].  It is forbidden for a Variona’Sha clan to make war against another clan.  Due to the very low numbers of [[Elves|Elf]], it is taboo to kill fellow [[Elves|Elf]].  In place of clan wars, there exists the [[Melaniacha'hogga]].  Every year, this tournament combat determines what tribe’s chieftain becomes [[chief of chiefs|Chief Of Chiefs]], and may lead all clans.  Challenges and squabbles are also settled with impromptu tournaments.  While outright war is never encountered between two clans, there are often bitter relations between two clans with conflicting ideals or past grievances.  Bronze Elves relate wisdom with age, and the clan elders are well respected for their advice and council.  While the chief has final say over the affairs of the tribe, he often will consult with the elders, and with the [[Shamans|Variona'Sha Shaman]].

!The Face Of Elven Society
The Variona’Sha are the face of the [[Elves|Elf]] in [[Kellos]].  It is the Variona’Sha that have ties to the [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] and [[Human]] empires, not the [[Forana'loloKashira]].  The Variona’Sha then in turn can be considered the middle-man between the [[Forana'loloKashira]] and the rest of the world.  This is one of the many forms in which the Bronze Elves protect their forest brethren.  Most [[clans|Variona'Sha Clans]] live to the far east, and have little contact with the western civilizations.  Their attachment to the eastern lands is due to the strong presence of [[Orcs|Orc]] there, which they are in constant warfare with.

<pre>[[Variona'Sha]] clans are based on animals found in nature (Elk, Bear, Eagle, etc).  The tribe realizes the power of this totem animal and shapes their culture around it.  They wish to become one with their spirit animal.  The clan lives, acts and fights like their spirit animals.  There is a great respect for their totem animal.  They practice [[The Rite Of Sha]], an annual event used to determine which clan has the leading voice.

Clans have a chief, and a [[Shaman|Variona'Sha Shaman]].

The tribe even adopted a [[Human]] baby that was orphaned named [[Chandi]], taking her in as their own until she was of age to leave.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/bestiary/famous/vegvisir.jpg]]

Vegvisir (12,428 [[IO]] - current), The King, The Just, The Gilded, The Wise, The Leader, and the keeper of [[The Heart Of Azarad-Ji]], was an ancient male gold [[Dragon]] who lived in the [[remote mountainous land|The Northlands]] of [[Kellos]].  The most notable characteristics of Vegvisir are his golden scales and gargantuan size.

Since a wyrmling, he is said to have confounded poets with his lyrics, philosophers with his contemplations, and rulers with his regulations.  As a result, he became a symbol and myth to the people of [[The Northlands]].  Vegvisir was thought to aid lost travelers in their quests for adventure.  His price for guidance was fair and just: a gemstone, a sum of gold, or a far-off tale he had never heard.  If he found the price too low, he would speak in riddles and rhymes.

Vegvisir has been known to ruthlessly hunt and slay [[Dathairä]], displaying their tattered remains in his lair as a warning to those who dare disrespect him.  His wrath and disdain for the [[Dathairä]] knows no bounds, and he despises their kind.

With age came solitude as Vegvisir has not been seen for centuries.  Most believe the clever [[Dragon]] to be nothing but a myth.  Despite this, tales were spread of a [[Dragon]] hunter who stole his golden scales.  True believers claim that the large shadows seen overhead or the mystic fog surrounding the mountain tops are more than just a trick of the eye; and many still seek the wisdom of this massive golden beast.

!Reborn As The King
In 1026 [[AAP]], after decades of succumbing to the corruption of [[Yuv'Dah'Akh]], Vegvisir had lost much of his splendor and was more feral beast than [[Dragon]].  [[The Travelers]], in seeking to put an end to [[Yuv'Dah'Akh]], stumbled upon what was left of Vegvisir and his lair.  Upon slaying him, they felt pity and sorrow and wished to resurrect him to his previous glory.  While they failed, they called upon the [[Fragment Of Qualok]] who merged with the spirit of Vegvisir - creating a new entity that was half Vegvisir and half [[Qualok]].  In this form, Vegvisir guides the young [[Apotheons|Apotheon]] in [[Elysium]].</pre>

Velivelo, known as &quot;The White City&quot; in [[Elvish]], is the imposing fortress-city that serves as the heart of [[Lord Filvenedore's|Lord Filvenedore]] dominion over [[The Winter Court]] of [[The Feywild]].  Spanning an icy valley with bridges and spires that pierce the sky, Velivelo is both a stronghold and a symbol of [[Lord Filvenedore's|Lord Filvenedore]] unyielding power.  The walls and buildings are made of shimmering ice and stone that glisten under the pale light of the sun, casting an ethereal glow across the frozen landscape.

!The Icy Plains
Surrounding Velivelo is a vast expanse of icy plains, a desolate and treacherous landscape that stretches as far as the eye can see.  These plains are dotted with the frozen forms of [[Lord Filvenedore's|Lord Filvenedore]] enemies, transformed into ice statues as a grim warning to any who would dare challenge his authority.  These statues are scattered across the plains, their lifelike expression of terror and agony preserved for eternity in the unforgiving ice.  The sight of these statues is meant to inspire fear and submission to those who approach the city, serving as a stark reminder of the consequences of defying [[The Pale Prince|Lord Filvenedore]].

!The Slumbering Queen
Deep within the fortress, [[Queen]] [[Naurase]], wife of [[Lord Filvenedore]] slumbers within a bed of ice.  Afflicted with a magical curse that she cannot wake from, [[Lord Filvenedore]] is desperate to find a cure and be with his beloved once more.

He holds mortals and non-[[Fey]] in contempt, seeing them as fickle and untrustworthy.  [[Lord Filvenedore]] does not delight in the merrymaking and adornment of flowers and beauty like his allies.  He sees these things as unnecessary, instead focusing his attention on thwarting the [[Fomorians|Fomorian]] from gaining a stronger foothold in his domain. |

Her deep love for [[Lord Filvenedore]] is legendary, symbolizing their fated connection that transcends time.

[[Akut]] shares a deep, unbreakable bond with [[Lord Filvenedore]], serving as his trusted general in the relentless war against the [[Fomorians|Fomorian]].  Together, they partake in [[The Wild Hunt]], where [[Akut]] bears [[Lord Filvenedore]] in a vain attempt to seek a cure for [[Queen]] [[Naurase]] by collecting the blood of mortals.

<div title="Vesna Zeuxis" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202307301343" modified="202311080305" tags="person" changecount="29">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/vesna-zeuxis/vesna-zeuxis.jpg]]

Vesna Zeuxis (37 [[IO]] - 16 [[AAP]]) was a gifted princess from [[Uskard]] blessed with the gift of [[Foretelling]], enabling her to perceive glimpses of the future.  She was a prominent historical figure on the continent of [[Uskard]], renowned for her mystical gifts and pivotal role in the cataclysmic event known as [[The Destruction Of Uskard]].

!Gift Of Foretelling
Born into the royal family of [[The Zmejskala Sovereignty]] to [[Nasar Zeuxis]] and [[Zamana Abi-Eskandari Zeuxis]], Vesna spent her early childhood in the vibrant city of [[Jakah]].  From a young age, it became evident that she possessed an extraordinary gift, the ability to see visions of events yet to unfold. This gift of [[Foretelling]] set her apart from the other children and brought her both admiration and trepidation within the superstitious [[Uskardeen]] society.  Her visions caused her to mature quickly, and in 35 [[IO]], at the tender age of 2, she saw a vision of [[The&amp;nbsp;Destruction&amp;nbsp;Of Her Homeland|The Destruction Of Uskard]] and began to warn anyone who would listen.  Many believed her vision, but not her paranoid [[father|Nasar Zeuxis]]. 
Vesna Zeuxis' most significant and pivotal vision was that of an ancient malevolent entity that she named &quot;[[The Sundering Shadow]]&quot;.  In her visions, she witnessed the awakening of this powerful being, foretelling [[the cataclysm|The Destruction Of Uskard]] that would befall [[Uskard]].  The entity was [[Haamnaa Srozzen]], an [[Oni]] of immense destructive power that brought about the tragic event known as [[The Destruction Of Uskard]] in 29 IO, commonly referred to as [[The Mourning]].

!The Escape To Kellos
Faced with the dire vision of impending destruction, by age 8 in 29 [[IO]], Vesna Zeuxis courageously attempted to warn her people and convince [[her father|Nasar Zeuxis]], one of the leaders of [[The Zmejskala Sovereignty]], to take action.  However, [[Nasar Zeuxis]] dismissed her warnings as mere paranoia, leading Vesna and her loyal followers to take it upon themselves to defy his orders and seek refuge across the sea in the land of [[Kellos]].

[[Nasar Zeuxis]] was furious, and sent an army to stop his people from fleeing.  Vesna and her people rapidly boarded vessels in the port city of [[Khurdilan]].  As her father's army approached, dark red clouds formed in the sky and the princess knew the&amp;nbsp;destruction&amp;nbsp;had begun.  Fire rained from the sky, destroying both her fleet of ships and the approaching army.  Refugees clung to rafts and makeshift vessels and traveled the great distance to&amp;nbsp;[[Kellos]].  Many died from starvation and thirst along the difficult journey.

!Forging A New Home In Kellos
The refugees landed in [[The Stone Lands]] of [[Kellos]], near the homestead of [[Cyril Viridian]], a [[Praetor]] of [[The Old Republic]].  [[Cyril|Cyril Viridian]], recently a father, was impressed by this small girl who was leading her people surprisingly well, and he met them with kindness.  The moment her feet touched the ground, she received visions of [[The Demon Plague]] and the oncoming destruction of [[Kellos]].  Unlike her father, [[Cyril Viridian]] listened and escorted her and her people to [[The Senate|The Old Republic]] to warn them of the impending carnage.  Along the way, Vesna informed [[Cyril|Cyril Viridian]] that his [[Senate|The Old Republic]] would not listen and was decaying and doomed to fail.  While dismayed, [[Cyril Viridian]] knew this to be true.

When [[The Old Republic]] rebuffed their audience, [[Cyril Viridian]] was outraged; pushing him over the edge to take matters into his own hands.  Traveling with Vesna and her retinue, he and his family followed her on her vision to a promised land.  Where she saw a new beginning, [[Cyril Viridian]] saw an army.  Vesna traveled to [[The Waste]] where her people carved the city of [[Amnar]].  Her people later helped [[Cyril Viridian]] fight his [[Azutan Nagyos]] or (&quot;War of the Mages&quot; in [[The Old Tongue]]), and solidify his position as [[Emperor]].

!The Death Of The First Empress
Vesna married [[Athilis Viridian]] in 14 [[IO]], and later rose to the position of [[Empress]] of [[The Viridian Empire]] in 11 [[AAP]].  She integrated the [[Uskardeen]] people into [[The Empire|The Viridian Empire]] and died tragically soon after attempting to form relations with [[The Nissido Dynasty]] of [[Uskard]].  She was found dead in 16 [[AAP]] at the base of her tower, apparently having leapt from a balcony.  Her husband, [[Emperor]] [[Athilis Viridian]] was distraught and convinced there was foul play, as Vesna was full of life and vigor.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/amon/copper/viridia-tasia.jpg]]
Viridia Tasia (1004 [[AAP]] - Current) is the [[Tribune]] of [[The Polité Of Copper]] of [[The Amoni Concord]], [[The Elder Of Copper]], [[Sister Of Blood And Shield|The Sisters Of The Blood And Shield]], and governor of [[The Elden Reaches]].  She is the only daughter of [[Cora|Cora Tasia]] and [[Andreas Tasia]] and has one brother [[Cato Tasia]] who is five years her senior.

!The Elder Of Copper
Viridia was bred for the position of [[The Elder Of Copper]], as only women can successfully hold the post.  This matriarchal system has been in place since the founding of [[The Amoni Concord]].  [[Her mother|Cora Tasia]] was a stern and diligently teacher of the harsh reality that comes with ruling.  Against her mother's teachings, Viridia always kept her heart for her common folk - and was able to demonstrate both empathy and the ability to quickly make morally taxing decisions.  She has read &quot;[[Moral Being]]&quot; written by her colleague [[Proculus Vindex]] many times and tries to emulate [[The Elder Of Bronze]] in her ruling style.

!Assassination Attempts
Though Viridia is loved by her people, she is despised by her older brother, [[Cato|Cato Tasia]] who is jealous of the love and attention lavished upon her.  She has survived two assassination attempts throught to be linked to [[Cato|Cato Tasia]].
The first attempt was at the tender age of 10, while she was visiting the people of [[The Elden Reaches]].  Ignoring the warnings to keep her distance from the &quot;lesser folk&quot;, Viridia was instead eager to immerse herself with them as her mentor had written about in his book.  An assassin was waiting for her upon her arrival, although none but those in the palace knew about her exact location.  Her bodyguard, [[Tyronius Acisculus]], thwarted the would be assassin, killing him there in the street.  When the assailant was unmasked, he was identified as 15 year old [[Hasbo Carta]], a known confidant of [[Cato Tasia]].
The second and most recent attempt happened at Viridia's 16th birthday celebration.  Cloaked figures invaded the palace through a back entrance that had been mysteriously left open and unguarded.  [[Tyronius|Tyronius Acisculus]], along with other palace guards, protected the [[Tribune]].  Two of the intruders were captured and the others were killed (all men).  Those who were captured took their own lives instead of giving up their employer.  Despite the evidence that [[Cato|Cato Tasia]] was involved in both attempts, Viridia chooses to believe there is still good in him and doesn't want to believe that her brother hates her.  She doesn't allow any harm to come to him.

!Personality
A keen mind and a gentle aura are the qualities she exudes.  She was taught to be firm and unyielding so she isn't seen as weak, but she has always been softer in spirit and feels for those who are less fortunate than herself.  She saw how her brother was left out and often forgotten and how that affected him.  She wishes to rule with a velvet glove instead of an iron fist.

!The Disappearance Of Cora Tasia
Viridia was thrust into her role at the age of 16, when her mother [[Cora Tasia]] mysteriously disappeared and was assumed dead.  Viridia had been training her life for this role, but the circumstances of her ascendance left her feeling uncertain and unprepared.  Her mother's abscence left a hole in her that she has yet to be able to fill.  She is still searching for her.</pre>

When [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] reach the age of 15 and are found to possess the gift, they are removed from their [[Dwarvish Clan]] and enrolled under the care of [[The Undermountain Papacy]].  Being one of the Volg'gogan, or &quot;stone blessed&quot; is one of the highest honors in [[Dwarvish|Dwarf]] culture.  It is they that see to the well being of the [[Stonghold]], and along with the military, defend it with their lives.

The most holy of the Volg'gogan is named [[Kestaz]], and is the mouthpiece of [[Kombar]] for the [[Stronghold]].  They have the ability to dispense divine justice, and the position affords nearly as much power as the king (or &quot;dorn&quot; in [[Dwarvish]])

The [[Krogan'al'Volg'gogan]] is a council of the stone blessed elected by the [[Kestaz]].  Often comprised of masters who train new recruits and see to the daily operations of [[The Undermountain Papacy]].</pre>

!Deathlocks
The forging of a pact between a Warlock and a Patron is no minor occasion - at least not for the Warlock.  The consequences of breaking that pact can be dire and, in some cases, lethal.  A Warlock that fails to live up to a bargain with a Patron runs the risk of rising from the dead as a [[Deathlock]], an [[Undead]] driven to serve its otherworldly Patron.</pre>

Waywill (76 [[IO]] to 16 [[AAP]]) was known to many of his time as &quot;The Lifehealer&quot;.  He is considered to be one of the most outstanding figures in the history of [[Magic]].  Historians agree that Waywill was born on the frontier of what is now known as [[The Green Sea]], and had contact with the [[Forana'loloKashira]].  Skilled in [[Wizardry]], he learned to master the secrets of [[Druidic]] [[Magic]] by the [[Elf]] scholars who named him [[Malthuelfe]] in their language meaning &quot;Elf Friend&quot;.

He is renowned for founding a school in the [[Human]] territories dedicated to teaching the ways of leveraging [[Magic]] to diagnose, discover and treat of disease.  Waywill was fascinated with the differences between [[Magic]] and [[Divine Favor]], and dedicated much of his research to understanding, comparing and contrasting the two powers.

It is said that it was [[Fazar]] who called for Waywill and his healers to assist in fighting [[The Holy Scourge]] and curing [[The Demon Plague]].  After studying the effects of the plague, it quickly became clear that it was magical in nature.  Waywill and his students went to work cleansing the minds, bodies and [[Souls|Soul]] of those effected.  The combined efforts of [[Mysara]], [[Armondax]], [[Fazar]], and Waywill saw [[The Holy Scourge]] defeated.  During the ensuing war and chaos, [[Cyril Viridian]] overthrew the government and installed himself as [[Emperor]].  [[Cyril Viridian]] saw [[Magic]] as the root of all problems and declared [[Azutan Nagyos]] (translated to &quot;war of the mages&quot; in [[The Old Tongue]]).  A disgust for [[Magic]] had permeated the land and the four wizards formed what is now known as [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].

After years of fighting, the [[Azutan Nagyos]] was lifted, and magic was no longer outlawed.  It is not documented why the war ended, however [[Cyril Viridian]] saw to the foundation of [[The Magian Imperium]] to govern the use of magic throughout [[The Viridian Empire]].  Waywill was appointed as the first [[Lord Magister]] of [[The Magian Imperium]].</pre>

The Wendigo is a horrific creature formed by a sentient forest of [[The Feywild]] when it is attacked or threatened.  It was once a peaceful spirit; but now has shaggy fur, long claws, and a skeletal head crested with large antlers.

A Wendigo is a spirit driven to madness, fueled by hunger and rage.  They attack anything indiscriminately, often after stalking it's prey.  They are caught between worlds, and capable of [[plane|The Planes Of Existence]] shifting beyond [[The Feywild]].

''-Whyenne Loom (contemplating his growing power)''
}}}

Whyenne Caxton Loom (c: 1005 [[AAP]] - Current) was a player character run by [[Maika Danford]].  He rose to the power of an [[Apotheon]] of LUCK/FORTUNE, ARCANA, and SOUL; and turned down the life of a [[God|The Gods]] in [[Elysium]] in order to spend his remaining mortal years on [[Asha]] with his redeemed father, [[Caxton Loom]] and his friends [[Creena Lake]] and [[Thorgil Moresson]] who were loyal to [[Caxton Loom]] when he was [[The Salt King]].

As a young boy, Whyenne sailed with his overbearing father and lived the life of one of [[The Mummers]].  Young Whyenne stood upon the deck of his father's ship as [[Caxton Loom]] ascended to the title of [[The Salt King]] in a battle of force.  During the conflict, Whyenne fell into the ocean and would have drowned if he was not saved by the [[Seraph]] [[Umberlee]] who appeared to him as a goddess of the sea and saved him as she could sense the budding power in the boy.  Forever touched by the experience, he retained his love of the sea.

!The Twin Souled
When his father [[Caxton Loom]] was removed from power as [[The Salt King]], a dark [[Blood Magic]] ritual was performed that removed [[Caxton Loom's|Caxton Loom]] soul and placed it within Whyenne, turning his father into a mindless zombie beholden and commanded by the new [[Salt King|The Salt King]].  Before Whyenne's fate could be determined, he was stolen away by [[Creena Lake]] and [[Thorgil Moresson]] - two pirates still loyal to [[Caxton Loom]] who whisked Whyenne away into hiding far away on the continent of [[Kellos]].  Always on the run, the two raised Whyenne to understand and be true to his [[Kellish|Kell]] heritage, much as his father would have wanted.

!The Traveler
Sensing defensiveness from [[Creena|Creena Lake]] and uncovering lies about his past that both [[Creena|Creena Lake]] and [[Thorgil|Thorgil Moresson]] told him; Whyenne ran away to explore the open world for himself.  Once free from their protective grasp, Whyenne met the [[Orc]] [[Paladin]] and former [[Slave|Slavery]] [[Staz Amrius Kafanz]] in a small hostel in [[Bandor]].  Together they worked to improve the lives of a small population of recently emancipated [[Slaves|Slavery]].  Looking for work they met up with an [[Elven|Elf]] [[Druid]] named [[ElethaNori]] and a [[Human]] [[Warlock]] named [[Aereon Zara Al-Wali]].  This adventuring band became inseparable, and it was during this time that Whyenne grew in power and began to master all forms of [[Magic]].  

!The Hero
It did not take long for The Travelers to uncover a plot to destroy [[The Divine Gate]] by the [[Aboleth]] [[Yuv'Dah'Akh]].  In Whyenne's journey and rise to power he mastered life and death as well as time itself.  His full rise to the power of an [[Apotheon]] was with the help of a [[Fragment Of Qualok]].  When all hope seemed lost, and [[Yuv'Dah'Akh]] was close to succeeding in his desire to break [[The Divine Gate]], Whyenne used his power to stop time such that his friend [[Staz Amrius Kafanz]] could move beyond time to kill [[Yuv'Dah'Akh]].

{{quote{
//“I don’t know how I’ll die, but I do know I will get to choose. If I die in battle, whether it be by sword, magic, or flame, it will be because I chose to fight. If I die in bed, old and sick, it will be because I chose to lay down and rest.”//
''-Whyanne Loom''
}}}

!The Renounced Apotheon
When given ultimate cosmic power and the chance to change anything in the universe, Whyenne chose to first test and confirm that his father [[Caxton Loom]] was not beyond redemption.  When he was comfortable that there was still good within his father, he restored his soul - awakening him again to life and his own free will.  Rather than reign as a [[Apotheon]] in [[Elysium]] with his friends, he instead chose a more humble future where he could travel the world with his father and reclaim the lost years that were stolen from them.

While he does not speak much of it, some scholars can only note two miracles performed by Whyenne in his brief time as [[Apotheon]] compared to the three more commonly found across the others of his kin.  For those brave enough to ask Whyenne about the third miracle, he says nothing and only smiles wryly.

!The Author And Skald
He is a prolific author of books, stories, and songs.  Most notably [[From Mortal To Apotheon and Back Again]], Whyenne personal story of his time with a number of the [[Apotheons|Apotheon]].

!Husband Of Seraph
After traveling [[Asha]] for some time, Whyanne again felt the connection to the [[Seraph]] [[Umberlee]].  After a prolonged courtship, [[Umberlee]] and Whyanne eventually married and had 7 children.  Six daughters: [[Rivule Loom]], [[Vapos Loom]], [[Tempestus Loom]], [[Limus Loom]], [[Rainey Loom]], [[Afshak Loom]] and their youngest, as son, [[Caxoreon Loom]].</pre>

Wickers are motes of concentrated magical energy that feed on other sources of [[Magic]], found within [[The Boneyard]].  This location is a [[Mana]] dead zone within [[The Orcish Lands]].  They are assumed to be made from concentrated [[Mana]], and move in a slow flowing motion towards the center of [[The Boneyard]] known as [[The Sink]].  No one knows their cause nor their purpose once they reach [[The Sink]], but there are many theories.  Some believe they are the life force of the creatures who die within [[The Boneyard]], while others believe they are a magical reaction caused by the draining of [[Magic]].

The Wickers do not appear to be alive, as they do not react to any physical touch.  They have the ability to move through objects and creatures.  They only react to the casting of arcane magical spells, in which case they alter their course to the source of the casting.  If the Wicker touches any living being, that creature will feel their life force drained in the form of 1d4 Constitution damage.  When a Wicker damages a create in this way, it grows slightly in size.  The larger a Wicker becomes, the more agency it shows over its movements.</pre>

Wizards are users of [[Magic]] that through scholarly study can use the weave of [[Mana]] to manipulate the world.  Wizards treat [[Magic]] like a science, and require an [[Arcane Focus]] to cast spells.  Some seek to unlock the secrets of the universe, while others are lured by knowledge and research.  This learning requires years of study and practice to cultivate; honing one's Wizardry requires learning the right combinations of incantations and rituals.  Anyone is capable of Wizardry given the right amount of time and study.

!Spell Book
Every arcane spell has a written version, recorded in a [[Spell Book]].  Wizards use a detailed [[Spell Book]] to document their knowledge and study it every morning to commit to memory the spells they have prepared for that day.  A single spell can take up multiple pages of the [[Spell Book]], with most spellbooks being over one hundred pages long.

!Arcane Focus
Unlike [[Sorcerers|Sorcery]], Wizards require an [[Arcane Focus]] to cast their spells.  This is either a pouch containing the needed materials and components to cast the desired spells; or an object imbued as a Wizards [[Arcane Focus]] such as a wand, orb or staff.

!Arcane Schools
[[Abjuration]], [[Alkemancy]], [[Conjuration]], [[Divination]], [[Enchantment]], [[Evocation]], [[Glamour]], [[Illusion]], [[Meta Magic]], [[Summoning]], [[Transmutation]], [[Traveling]], [[Runes]]

!Familiars
[[Familiars|Familiar]] are Wizardly companions that are summoned into the body of an animal.  A wizard has a bond with their [[Familiar]]; they have the ability to communicate telepathically and can use their senses, as well as cast some spells through them.  [[Familiars|Familiar]] are spirits from [[The Shadowfell]] or [[The Feywild]], yet they arrive in the form of a common animal such as a Toad, Cat, or Ferret.  In rare occasions, the spirit arrives in its natural form of a creature from [[The Feywild]] or [[The Shadowfell]].  It is possible to use [[Magic]] to alter the form of the [[Familiar]], but it's natural state is that of what it arrives in when the Wizard first summons them.

!Wizards In Society
The foremost center of Wizardry knowledge and study is [[The Athenaeum]] in the city of [[Zylok]] located on the continent of [[Kellos]].</pre>

A grand structure of multiple stories of tomes, scrolls, manuscripts and books from across the world.  It is said that the answer to every question is contained within these halls.  However, it is difficult to find materials pertaining to a certain subject and often requires both research and knowledge of ancient [[Languages]] and a proficiency in magical research.|
| [img[images/locations/uskard/jakah/the-palace-of-the-way-preview.jpg]] &lt;br&gt;[[The Palace Of The Way]] [[--USKARD--|Uskard]] |[[The Palace Of The Way]] (or &quot;Palata na patot&quot; in [[Uskaran]]) is the oldest known religious structure in [[Asha]].

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/ruje/tszanthus/wright.jpg]]
Wrythilda Blackthorn (564 [[AAP]] - Current), more commonly known as Wright, is a purple-skinned [[Tiefling]] power broker in [[The Lower Streap]] of the city of [[Tszanthus]] on the continent of [[Ruje]].  She is the owner of [[The Delver's Well]] as well as the fight club known as [[The Crucible]].  As charismatic, cunning and beautiful, she is known for a sweet yet highly lethal charm and a morbid sense of humor.  Wright cares a good deal for fashion, and makes sure her clothing is always the latest style.

She embraced her infernal heritage, using her unique appearance and innate charm to her advantage.  Wright learned at a young age how to size up opponents, seize opportunities, and exploit weaknesses.  Later in life, she quickly carved out a niche for herself as a power broker in the underworld of [[Tszanthus]].  An entertainer at heart, she bought [[The Delver's Well]], a feasthall that catered to the city's most influential figures.  The establishment became a hotspot for clandestine deals and discreet meetings, where the elite mingled with criminals and secrets were exchanged over delectable dishes.

In order to dissuade violence in [[The Delver's Well]], Wright established [[The Crucible]]; an underground fight club hidden beneath the establishment.  [[The Crucible]] became a den of savagery and adrenaline, attracting both desperate fighters seeking glory and wealthy patrons looking for entertainment.  Wright's shrewd business accumen ensured that she profited from every bout, earning her a fearsome reputation as a master manipulator and provider of bloodsport.

Behind her beguiling smile and impeccable fashion sense, Wright's true motivations lie in vanity, ego, and greed. While she cares deeply about her own image and status, she shies away from the complications that come with running a major organization, preferring to pull strings from the shadows and let others do her bidding.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/bestiary/wyvern.jpg]]

|&gt;|&gt;|!Wyvern|
|ST: 20-30|Speed/Dodge: 20/10|Size: 10 hexes|
|DX: 14|PD/DR: 2/3|Weight: 800-1,100 lbs|
|IQ: 6|Damage: *|Habitat: Mountain|
|HT: 14/24-30|&gt;|Reach: C,1,2|
|&gt;|&gt;|* Tail barb is 1d+2 imp, Talons 1d-1 cut, Bite 1d+1 imp|

Wyverns are distantly related to [[Dragons|Dragon]], however only have hind legs and possess a barbed poisonous tail.  On land they crawl on their wing tips and are reduced to a speed of 3 and dodge of 7.  They are solitary creatures typically found within tangled forest, great caverns, and the like.  They are rather stupid, but very aggressive, and wyverns will always attack.  Wyverns have scales that range from drab brown to black, and have four eyes on their head that are often red, orage or green.

A wyvern will strike with its tail (2 hex reach), often from the air, and then land to carry off its prey;  it can carry up to Medium encumbrance.  Its barbed tail can penetrate up to heavy leather armor or chainmail , but nothing thicker.  Against a metal armored foe, a wyvern is faily helpless, though it will slam-attack an armored opponent to get to less armored prey.  

The tails venom is very strong.  Anyone stung must make a roll against HT - 6.  Failure means the venom does 2d damage in addition to any damage done by the barb, and the victim is at -4 DX for the next three days - critical failure means instant death.  If the HT - 6 roll is made, the victim takes only half damage (in addition to the damage done by the barb), and is at -2 DX for the next three days.  The wyvern can strike up to 20 times before exhausting its venom, and takes about 8 hours to replace each dose used.

They resemble large greyhounds, standing 4-5 feet high at the shoulder and weighing about 400 pounds.  Their short fur is dull, often blending into darkness and leaving only the cherry-red glow of their eyes and the smell of chilled smoke to indicate their presence.  They possess an oddly human-like visage, with protruding noses in place of muzzles and more flexible necks than those of canines.  Their ears are short and pointed, curving upwards and away from the rest of the head in such a way that they resemble horns.</pre>

Yurtrus is a [[Dathairä]] in the form of a beautiful [[Elven|Elf]] maiden, with horns, wings and a barbed tail.  She is often accompanied by nearly a dozen small servants and sycophants who see to her every whim and desire.

She has an infatuation with [[Dispater]], attracted to the mortal life force that still clings to his form.

!Desire
Yurtrus uses the yearnings of her victims - lust, wealth, power - to her advantage.  She has the ability to affect the mind and allow herself to assume disguises and even alter the environment to suit her purposes.  As a result, many who become her prey never realize it.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/bestiary/famous/zenriah.jpg]]
Zenriah was one of the three mighty golems created by [[Kombar]] to assist him in crafting a prison for [[Azarad-Ji]] and a tomb for [[Valouria]].  It was forged from translucent crystal that would take on different colors and properties depending on the golem's current function.  When the golem was active, intricate patterns would shine emblazoned upon its crystalline surface; magical and ethereal runes that were masterfully crafted by [[Kombar]] that gave the golem its power.

!Imprisoning ~Azarad-Ji
Zenriah was forged with the monumental task of creating the prison one of the most powerful beings in existence, [[Azarad-Ji]].  It did so diligently, and as this remains its primary purpose will not hesitate to eliminate those who attempt to free or aid [[Azarad-Ji]] in [[The Eternal Conflict]].  It was Zenriah who immobilized [[Azarad-Ji]] with a deep slumber that warded others from his vicious attacks.  Zenriah's crystalline structure played a critical role in warding off the chaotic energies and influence emanating from the prison.

!Forged with Spirit and Protection
While its hulking form was imposing, [[Zenriah]] held a gentle spirit that was calm and contemplative.  It was a gentle giant, willing to listen and understand before acting, even to those with the most wicked of hearts.  This made Zenriah the optimal choice to guard [[The Valourian Veil]] - the final resting place of [[Valouria's|Valouria]] spirit.  It faithfully protected [[The Veil|The Valourian Veil]] and all within it, acting as caretaker of this solemn location.

!The Crystal Stave Of Zenriah
Zenriah was subdued by the [[Archfey]] [[Hag]] [[Babaroga]], when she stumbled upon the location of [[The Veil|The Valourian Veil]].  It's fighting spirit never left it, even after its defeat.  it's crystalline body was forged into [[The Crystal Stave Of Zenriah]], and the crystal still rages in eternal fury within the staff that [[Babaroga]] wields.</pre>

Zezebazum is the ancient and powerful [[Dathairä]] who rules [[The Circle Of Lies|Cania]] in [[Baator]].  He was personally responsible for the [[Desecration]] that led to the demise of [[The Sylvan Empire]] through the corruption of the [[Kiraga]]. The [[Elves|Elf]] call Zezebazum Quenaachawiere, which translates into “the speaker of untruth” or &quot;the deceiver&quot;.  The [[Elves|Elf]] despise him as much as [[Azarad-Ji]] himself.
He seeks to bring about [[Desecration]], and nearly succeeded at ending [[The Fourth Age]] along with [[Teldinath Dagon]] during what is known as [[The Demon Plague]].

!A Cunning Deceiver
Zezebazum has a monstrous appearance, simply looking at his natural form can cause fear.  He has the ability to transform himself to look like any living creature he has seen for up to 2d hours; and uses this power to appear harmless while preaching the word of his wicked master [[Azarad-Ji]].  He is patient, cunning, and a master deceiver.  He first attempts to beguile before resulting to brute force and aggression.

!Ruler Of Cania
Zezebazum rules [[Cania]], [[The Circle Of Lies|Cania]].  As his master [[Azarad-Ji]] is gone, it is Zezebazum who controls the [[Dathairä]].  He seeks to free his master once again, but it content with his position and power. </pre>

|Population:|30,000.  70% [[Human]] and 30% [[Dwarf]] (at last census)|
|Fortifications:|Magically fortified stone walls (essential Earth).|
|Law:|Zylok trains wizards for warfare and defense.  Their militia, known as [[The Zylokian Magus]] also functions as a city guard.  All officers are wizards.  There are about 1200 men in the militia.  In times of war they can muster 5000+.  Only licensed wizards may perform magic within the city walls.  Felonious magicians will be fined or imprisoned depending on the severity of their magic use.|
|Resources:|Zylok is known as a city of knowledge.  Therefore the city is a leading manufacturer of ink (both fine and ordinary) and paper products.  Little food is grown locally and nearly all consumables are imported from nearby cities and settlements.|

!Description
This colorful city was originally founded by a community of [[mages|Magic]] wishing to seek peace from the non-magic peoples of the mainland.  In those days magic was considered taboo, and was often looked upon fearfully.  The city has now grown into the largest city on [[The Isles]].  Boasting a large seaport, and strong walls, it is built in the rocky terrain in the shadow of the mountains.

Zylok has a bustling seaport where ships from the continents of [[Uskard]] and [[Amon]] dock and trade goods.  The city is built on rolling hills, with a thick wall surrounding the city made of glimmering shiny black obsidian.  Being a city founded by [[Wizards|Wizardry]], [[Magic]] is seen everywhere.  Topiary bushes of various animals (lions, bears, dragons and rabbits) adorn public buildings, all moving very imperceptibly and subtly and slowly such that their poses change throughout the day.  Those living in the city are grow accustomed to flashes and bursts of magical light emanating from [[Fort Adept]].  Street performers use magic to delight passerby - using illusion to create shapes and animals in thin air.

The buildings of the city are tightly arranged, with roofs made of a colorful array of ceramic tile.  Zylok boasts an [[Airship]] tower near the center of the city, reaching high into the sky.

The city is organized into the following districts
* __The Dock Ward__ - a run down seedy part of town.  Tall densely packed tenements leave most of the neighborhood in shadow at ground level.  Most of the streetlamps have had their glass smashed, and the smells of salt air and excrement lingers within the rows of run-down buildings.  This is the location of [[The Dragon’s Roost]].
* __The Candlekeep District__ - a quiet section of the city with quaint shops and three story brownstone homes.  This is the location of [[The Emporium Arcana]], as well as a crossroads known as Scholar's Square.
* __The Garden District__ - is where many noble families make their residence.  It is named for the many flowers, grass, and trees kept in the small lawns and gardens of the nobles.  [[Fenwick Vandergeist]] makes his home here.
* __The Station District__ - is where you will find [[The Zylokian Waystation]], in the southern section of the city.  This district is on the highest hill that the city was built upon and offers the best view of the city.


!Social Customs
* A large celebration is performed to celebrate the birthday of the [[Archmage]].  The grandness of the event is usually representation of the popularity of the [[Archmage]].

!Notable Characters
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-isles/zylok/eustacia-vaisanan-portrait.jpg][Eustacia Vaisanan]] [[Eustacia Vaisanan]] |__[[Eustacia Vaisanan]]__ is a pragmatic and presiding [[Shield]] of Zylok, [[Marshall]] of [[The Isles]] and head of [[House Vaisanan]].  She is a very keen negotiator even at the tender age of 22.  Her strong social skills give her a very high rapport with the populace.  [[Eustacia Vaisanan]] is the youngest [[Archmage]] in the city’s history.  She is incredibly powerful, and is considered a child prodigy in every respect.  She was trained and mentored by [[Fallim Haring]]. |
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-isles/zylok/fallim-haring-portrait.jpg][Fallim Haring]] [[Fallim Haring]] |__[[Fallim Haring]]__ was first appointed to the council by the [[Archmage]] [[Geblin Vaisanan]] and advised him through twenty prosperous years.  He served again as council to the [[Archmage]] [[Moll Vaisanan]], until his untimely death five years after his appointment.  Yet again [[Eustacia Vaisanan]], who at one time was his apprentice, called for his aid.  [[Fallim Haring]] is an excellent teacher and mentor, yet rarely takes on a student.  He only picks pupils that show great promise.  [[Fallim Haring]] has taught [[Eustacia Vaisanan]] everything that he knows and she has soaked in all of his knowledge.  Now he aids her with his wise council and experience.  She has surpassed all of his expectations, and now considers her an equal by all accounts.|
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-isles/zylok/eblom-mallis-portrait.jpg][Eblom Mallis]] [[Eblom Mallis]] |__[[Eblom Mallis]]__ is a former high-ranking military officer.  [[Eustacia Vaisanan]] appointed him to her council.  He feels that he was pressured into the position and would much rather have remained in the military.  He is angry and dour, resenting [[Eustacia Vaisanan]] and the council as a whole.  While he may be mean and nasty, deep down he would die for Zylok (a patriot’s patriot).  He simply feels his skills would be better served as a military man. |
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-isles/zylok/ismo-godal-portrait.jpg][Ismo Godal]] [[Ismo Godal]] |__[[Ismo Godal]]__ was a swindler and pirate, con man and thief.  He was captured within the walls of Zylok, ending his underworld career forever.  [[Eustacia Vaisanan]] convinced him to help her and ever since he has been devoutly loyal to her.  He never breaks his word and promised to serve Zylok in exchange for his life.  He has now found a purpose and a change of heart.  The city guard (who had been trying to nab him for years) thought it extremely easy to catch him.  Those who know him well think he had simply become disenchanted by his former roguish lifestyle.  He is fond of saying ‘There is no honor among thieves nowadays’, and is known to go on and on about ‘the good old days’.  He is now the best of friends with his former rival [[Reeve]] [[Kirk Dow]].  The [[Reeve]] had always seen the honor and potential in [[Ismo Godal]], and is now proud to have him on Zylok's side.|
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-isles/zylok/duncan-stoneheart-portrait.jpg][Duncan Stoneheart]] [[Duncan Stoneheart]] |__[[Duncan Stoneheart]]__ is a [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] [[Volg'gogan]] (or priest) of [[The Undermountain Papacy]] from the [[Stronghold]] of [[Avorbarath]].  He is a stubborn but gentle soul.  He always shows a gruff and harsh exterior, but despite appearances he is kind and caring.  He has a large soft spot for [[Eustacia Vaisanan]].  He is the first [[Dwarf]] to be appointed into the council.  [[The Undermountain Papacy]] sees this as an excellent connection to human bureaucracy.  The choice of [[Duncan Stoneheart]] for council was a stroke of political genius on the part of [[Eustacia Vaisanan]], as it gave the [[Dwarf]] people a voice in the local government and therefore increased their support for her.  The [[Dwarf]] no longer consider themselves foreigners within the city walls and now truly call Zylok their home.|
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-isles/zylok/kirk-dow-portrait.jpg][Kirk Dow]] [[Kirk Dow]] |__[[Kirk Dow]]__ is a respected and charismatic leader.  He is the [[Reeve]] of Zylok and in full command of Zylok’s military forces.  The [[Reeve]] follows the orders of the [[Archmage]], but is always consulted in military matters.  He is kind and fair, yet gruff and stern to those who appear to be up to no good.  He is best of friends with the nefarious [[Ismo Godal]].|
| [img[images/characters/kellos/the-isles/zylok/fenwick-vendergeist-portrait.jpg][Fenwick Vendergeist]] [[Fenwick Vendergeist]] |__[[Fenwick Vendergeist]]__ is a very eccentric, reclusive, elderly [[Half-Elf]] [[Wizard|Wizardry]] that has a tower within the city.

[[Fort Adept]] is said to be one of the hardest drill instruction camps in the realms.  Often loud explosions or flashing lights can be seen over the Fort’s walls, as the cadets are drilling.
*[[The Lavender Gate]] is an odd shop in [[The Dock Ward]] run by a [[Bairn]] named [[Nehga]].  Everything in the shop is purple, including the wares. 
*[[The Dragon’s Roost]] is a rough and tumble bar in [[The Dock Ward]] run by an ex-con named [[Kelly ‘Scar’ Scarsdale|Kelly Scarsdale]].  His business is a front for his skill in forging important Zylokian papers and documents.  Whether a person is searching for a false wizard license, or a writ from the [[Archmage]] herself, this is the place to get it.
* [[The Salty Goose]] is a respectable inn and tavern near the wharf.  The proprietor is a [[Bairn]] named [[Fulvus Twofoot]]
*[[The Grand Fellowship of Mages Guildhall]] is the only brick and mortar building that is openly owned and operated by the [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].  Only Fellows may enter, or stay within the walls
*[[The Emporium Arcana]] is one of the city's most prestigious magic shops in the city, boasting three floors of goods on display.  They supply materials to [[The Athenaeum]] students.
* [[Scone Of Stone]] is a bakery run by a [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] family.  [[Bardyn Heavybelly]] is the proprietor, and her daughter [[Emory Heavybelly]] is a student in [[The Athenaeum]].
* [[The Bandolier]] is a supply store run by [[Taran Hugh]], a broad shouldered man of [[Kellish|Kell]] decent.  He has a frock of red hair and a thick unkempt beard.  He has the look of a former adventurer, strong and mighty once but not has a beer belly.  The store sells much of the adventuring equipment one might need.
* [[Madame Ortho's Oddities]] is a curio show that sells high end trinkets, and is willing to buy ornate and strange items that are otherwise difficult to sell.  The shop is very cluttered and musty.</pre>

<pre>Borbata is an [[Uskardeen]] fighting style and a method of close combat against an armed or unarmed opponent in which one uses no weapon or only a short weapon.  As striking an armored opponent proves ineffective, this style uses joint locks, pins and throws to neutralize an enemy.  The concept is to use the opponents own force against them. 

''Borbata - (Physical Hard)''
This represents the skill in the martial art, and allows the character to learn the maneuvers of this style.  Additionally, you may parry with either of your hands as if it was a weapon using 2/3 your skill.  Any unarmed attacks you make do increased damage, add 1/5 your skill, rounded down, to your damage.  Any time you punch an armored foe with DR 3 or better, roll vs HT.  A failed role means you take 1d-2 damage.

''Arm/Wrist Lock''
You can twist an opponent's limbs, paralyzing or crippling him.  First, you must either successfully parry an attack in hand-to-hand combat (this //can// be a weapon attack, if the foe is no more than 1 yard away) or make a Grapple (using DX, or Borbata skill).  If you succeed, you grab one of the victim's arms.  //On the same turn//, roll a Quick Contest, your Arm Lock skill vs his DX, Wresting or Judo skill (whichever is best).  If you win, you have trapped his arm in a lock.  The attacker may indicate the particular nature of the lock (i.e. behind the foe's back, his arm extended from his side, etc).  You for may try to break free; use Arm Lock+4 or ST or Judo in another Quick Contest.  If you win, you have immobilized the arm; the victim can try to break free in subsequent rounds, but at a cumulative -1 penalty.
On the next turn, you may choose to inflict pain or damage on the trapped limb.  A third Quick Contest (Arm Lock or ST vs HT) is required.  The victim is at +3 if he has the High Pain Threshold advantage and your intention was only to cause pain.  If you win, you inflict one point of damage or //pain// (Causing DX and IQ penalties without actual damage) for every point by which you make the roll.  if you do crippling damage, you break the arm and hand you were holding; no further damage can be inflicted; but all further attempts to cause pain are at +3!  The arm lock counts as torture on an Interrogation roll [B66].  The victim must also make a Will roll minus the damage infliced, or drop any weapon he was holding in that hand.  Of course, if the hand or arm is crippled, any weapon held by it is automatically dropped.
Furthermore, other attacks may be infliced on the victim.  Close Combat attacks can be used against someone held by the lock; the victim defends at -4, in addition to any other penalties caused by the damage or pain cause by the lock itself.
Typically, a stick or [[Tonfa]] is used in conjunction as a lever to inflict an Arm Lock.  Use the rules above, except that the attacker uses the weapon skill.

''Disarming (Hard)''
This maneuver allows an unarmed man to take an attacker's weapon.  The defender must have successfully parried the weapon attack, or must grab the foe's weapon arm, as per [B111], substituting Disarming for DX.  On the next turn, a Quick Contest between Disarming and DX is necessary to remove the weapon.  A failure means the attacker keeps the weapon; a critical failure means a hit on the hand!  For weapons that have disarming capabilities, replace Disarming with the appropriate skill.

''Borbata Parry (Special - cannot be improved)''
The Borbata skill includes training in subtle footwork and evading blows.  This maneuver allows the character to guide a foe's attack away from or past himself, effectively allowing him to dodge the attack.  This still counts as a Parry, not a Dodge, and the character is still limited to his usually number of parries per turn.  Contact is not required but it is common, and this parry //can// be used to initiate an Arm Lock or Throw, or any other maneuver that can be initiated with a Parry.  Unlike a true Dodge, this parry cannot receive bonuses from Acrobatics or Boxing, nor may it be used against ranged weapons.  This maneuver is granted at no extra cost.

''Throw (Special - cannot be improved)''
This maneuver is described on [B51].  A martial artist may also inflict damage with the throw.  A thrown foe, if the attacker wishes, will take 1d-2 damage.  A successful throw at -6 to skill will result in the victim falling on his head, taking that damage to the brain.  A successful Breakfall roll will avoid this damage.  This maneuver is granted at no extra cost.</pre>
