Adam is a hired guard for [[The Grey Companions]]. He was a former city guard in [[Brand]], joining [[The Grey Companions]] based upon a sense of duty to help them on their mission to protect [[Asha]]. He is honest to a fault, and has an intolerance for [[Darklings|Darkling]].

Abram's father was a carpenter like his father before him.  As a young boy, Abram was raised to understand the skill of carpentry, and even helped build some of the structures within the city of [[Brand]].  When Abram was 15, he and his father traveled to [[Oxam]] for work.  There, his father was contracted to rebuild structures for the [[Darkling]] [[Gang]] known as [[The Family]].  Abram was unaware of the circumstances.  His father knew of their precarious situation, but needed the work and money.  Before their work was complete, an up and coming [[Darkling]] within the [[Gang]] known as [[Darius Kabald]] seized control and became [[Cloak]] through treachery.  He cancelled all contracts of the previous [[Cloak]], including the work of Abram and his father.  Outraged at not being able to be paid for his services, Abram's father confronted [[Darius Kabald]] and left with two broken hands.  Thus began Abram's hatred and mistrust for [[Darklings|Darkling]], and entry into the city guard of [[Brand]] to protect people like his father.

Abram is proud of his upbringing, his service as a city guard, and his new role as watchman for [[The Grey Companions]].  He enjoys the service he provides, and goes out of his way to ensure that he does an excellent job.  He is loyal and trustworthy, and takes pride in his honesty and integrity.  He is fiercely independent, and enjoys the long periods of solitude that guarding and protecting offer to him.

He has a family heirloom that is incredibly rare and valuable.  Three pictures from [[The First Age]] that were passed down from generation to generation.  The family story says that the image of the young man in the picture is Abram's ancestor.  Unknown to Abram, he owns photographs of an ancestor that was in the United States Air Force.  They depict Captain Jonathan &quot;Warhog&quot; Underberg in front of a fighter jet, in the cockpit with full helmet with his co-pilot behind him, and a third with a group of men in flight suits and dark sunglasses holding helmets.  On the back of the photos is a cursive handwritten note saying &quot;My dearest Madison, I miss you and Charlie so much.  Soon this will all be over an I'll be home soon!&quot;.  The photos are very fuzzy, and the language unknown and alien.</pre>

|Population:|60,000 (estimated permanent residents)|
|Fortifications:|5,000 infantry. [[The Westron Wall]] is the largest stone fortification in the realms.  It stretches from the nearby lake to the southern mountain ranges|
|Law:|Average|
|Resources:|Logging and carpentry is prevalent.  The city is also keen at smelting iron for nails, spikes, and fishhooks.  The city grows succulent grapes, and has spectacular vineyards.|

!Description
The city of Acharutha is built upon a [[large lake|Lake Acharutha]].  The city’s name is actually the [[ancient Elven name|The Sylvan Empire]] of the nearby lake (which translates to ‘Tranquility’).  The lake is the cities primary source of revenue.  The city originally began as a tight-knit fishing community.  Many centuries ago, [[barbarians of the western highlands|Kell]] constantly threatened Acharutha.  To protect themselves, the townsfolk erected [[The Westron Wall]].

!Social Customs
*Every year the citizens of Acharutha hold a festival dedicated to their lake’s inhabitant: [[Ruthie]].  Large floats are constructed depicting her in various forms, which are then paraded through the streets and then placed within [[Lake Acharutha]].
*It is customary for burials to be performed on the lake.  Cremation followed by sprinkling the ashes on the lakes surface is the cheapest form, placing the body on a raft and setting fire to it is more elaborate and expensive.

<pre>On a very rare occasion, a [[Forana'loloKashira]]  is born without the innate talent of [[Sorcery]].  They are called achasiono, roughly translated from [[Elvish]] this means unnatural.  Often they are feared for their unusual traits, as they also lack some of the basic racial traits that are integral to the wood elf (i.e. lack of the Beast Kin ability, lack of Perfect Balance or the desire to pursue romance).

Achasiono tend to be more serious than the traditional [[Forana'loloKashira]] and lack the same sense of humor.  These children often leave and rarely do they return to the [[Havens]].
  
Finally, mothers of achasiono never produce any offspring again.  Whether this is by choice and custom or biological is a mystery.  (It is stressed that the birth of an achasiono is very rare, encountering one is even more rare.  Few are even born, less than that survive to maturity, often getting into trouble or killing themselves.</pre>

Their uniqueness often extends to other [[Elvish|Elf]] sensibilities such as an affinity towards nature; and even the gift of immortality.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/items/airship/airship.jpg]]
Airships were invented in 1021 [[AAP]], the first of it's kind being [[The Airship Triumph]].  Airships fly using enchanted crystals known as [[Arkstones]].

Like any ships that sail on the water, airships have masts and sails - however they also possess steering wings that swing out on either side for guidance and stabilization.  Control of the ship was with a traditional wheel to control the rudder and steering panels, and a control rod made of silver and gold that allowed manipulation of the ship's vertical movement.

Airships can land in water and function as a typical sailing vessel - but are versatile in that they can also dock in the air when cities have built docking towers to accommodate the airship.  The invention of the airship revolutionized trade and travel, as they have the ability to move faster than a sailing ship when aloft in the air, can take direct routes to their destination, and do not require the expense of [[Wizards|Magic]] to use [[Teleportation Circles|Teleportation Circle]].

*Those who have lived in [[The Waste]] have little shame in showing their bodies.  Due to the oppressive heat, one frequently bathes naked within the [[public bath|The Akabele-ethu Public Baths]].  The heat also has one quickly shedding any heavy clothing during normal day to day activities.
*It is customary for those travelling the city streets to wear veils, or cloth covering their nose and mouth.  This keeps the dust away, and sun off of their skin.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Athenaeum/alana-underwood.jpg]]
Alana Underwood was a player character run by [[Elizabeth Disbrow]]

Alana Underwood was born in 1007 [[AAP]] in the fishing village of [[Willowbrook]] in [[The Summerset Isles]] near [[Zylok]].  Her parents are [[Caleb Underwood]] and [[Nia Henrick]], local fishmongers who work hard to provide for their family.  [[Caleb|Caleb Underwood]] has a small fishing vessel, and [[Nia|Nia Henrick]] and the children sell the fish in the village marketplace from a small stall.  Alana is the oldest of five children, her twin brothers [[Cody|Cody Underwood]] and [[Finn|Finn Underwood]], and her younger sisters [[Macey|Macey Underwood]] and [[Luna|Luna Underwood]].

Alana grew up resenting her ordinary life, fantasizing about life as a famous hero.  She read stories of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]], and dreamed of being a powerful [[Wizard]] such as them, and helping save [[Asha]] from the brink of destruction.  Tired of reeking of fish, she wanted more from her life than what her parents could provide.  She saw how worn out and common they all were, and wished instead she was born to a noble life.

Every year, [[The Athenaeum]] sends an envoy to the surrounding cities to seek new students.  When she was of age (in the year 1020 [[AAP]]), Alana was more than eager to take the tests that would provide her entry.  The applicants where lined up and each were handed a scroll of Dancing Lights.  They were asked to cast the spell and hold concentration for the full minute.  Most students can't do this without training; and [[The Athenaeum]] only accepts those who show the most aptitude.  Alana excelled, with a rudimentary understanding that concentration was not a physical act but one of accepting oneness with [[Mana]] - gaining this insight from reading stories of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].

Her parents were unaware that Alana applied, and were first hurt and saddened; knowing she would be forced to leave the family for more than 10 years of study.  But they saw how excited she was and they were proud and supportive parents.  As she boarded the vessel to [[The Athenaeum]], she made a quick decision to reinvent herself.  Alana no longer wanted to associate herself with the common fishmongers of [[Willowbrook]] and realizing her appearance matched the local nobles known as [[House Kensington]], created a new identity for herself posing as a distant relative.  She was mortified to learn that one of the Professors of the school was in fact a [[Kensington|House Kensington]].  Alana dropped her ruse as a [[Kensington|House Kensington]] but continued to hold herself with poise and confidence that comes with nobility.  She enjoys dressing in regal clothing, and prefers activities associated with nobility; despite her common upbringing.

She was put into an advisory group with a [[Half Elf]] named [[Ulan Nailo]] and a [[Tiefling]] known simply as [[Tsoofe]].  They became unlikely friends, and found themselves in the midst of much mischief.  Alana is considered lucky for having a [[Familiar]] whose origin is rare and unique.  [[Alana's Familiar|Alana Underwood's Familiar]] is named [[Nyx]], a [[Sprite]], born from an egg.</pre>

Alastair Neron (990 [[AAP]] - Current) is a Captain in the [[Zylokian Magus]] and Professor of [[Martial Magic]] &amp; [[Abjuration]] in [[The Athenaeum]].

Alastair had an idyllic childhood, brought up in the town of [[Waymeet]] on the outskirts of [[Zylok]] within [[The Viridian Empire]].  He was the treasured son of [[Ser]] [[Arthyan Neron]], a notable [[Knight]] who saw to the protection of the town as it's appointed [[Reeve]].  Alastair learned the skills of a warrior from his father at a very young age.  During his youth, he fostered a strong desire to be knighted like his father; and to this day values strength, courage, and loyalty above all else.

At the age of 18, Alastair joined the [[Zylokian Magus]]; the group responsible for protecting the region using both might and magic.  Here, he developed a unique knack for both [[Wizardry]] and Swordplay.

Here, he distinguished himself as a [[Witchhunter]]; one who would track down criminal users of [[Magic]] and bring them to justice.  He commissioned a pike, a long bladed spear made from the dark black [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] metal known as [[Kulgram]] that he named &quot;The Arbiter&quot;.

Following his father's death, Alastair Neron was the absent Lord of the Neron family estate in [[Waymeet]], including the family home.  Instead he settled in the city of [[Zylok]] where he found his calling as a Professor of magical studies in [[The Athenaeum]] under [[Headmaster]] [[Nester Arkwood]].

Alastair considered the students and faculty of [[The Athenaeum]] his family.  He enjoyed being able to impart his martial prowess into the budding [[Wizards|Wizardry]].  Alastair is unlike the other faculty members; 6'1&quot; tall and lean, but with the muscular build of a warrior.  He is a handsome man, whom younger female students from [[The Athenaeum]] have a crush on, and male students aspire to become. He is dashing, daring, and confident; and either ignorant of the adoration of the students or gentlemanly enough to disregard the attention with a kindly smile.

Following the attack on [[The Athenaeum]], Alastair found himself riddled with guilt and fury in the knowledge that he had failed to see the treachery of [[Penelope Kensington]] under his own nose; and allowed his guard to be down within the tranquil walls of the school.  He sees [[Blood Magic]] as a stain on [[Asha]] and harbors a hatred for it that borders on blind and unreasoning.

<pre>!Introduction
The following formulas are known by Alchemists of [[Asha]].  See [[Alchemy]] for more information as to how these formulas can be used to create items.  There are character level restrictions when attempting to create alchemical concoctions.

| !Rarity | !Character Level | !Learning Rate | !Creation DC |
| Common | 1st Or Higher | 5g / 1 workday | 10 |
| Uncommon | 1st Or Higher | 10g / 5 workdays | 15 |
| Rare | 5th Or Higher | 15g / 10 workdays | 20 |
| Very Rare | 11th Or Higher | 20g / 30 workdays | 25 |
| Legendary | 17th Or Higher | Unknown | Unknown |

!Acids, Poisons, and Toxins
''Acid (2g) __Common__''
As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact.  In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon.  On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.
//''Ingredients:'' Various//

''Antitoxin (5g) __Common__''
A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour.  It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.
//''Ingredients:'' [[Rowan Berries]]//

''Basic Poison (10g) __Common__''
You can use this poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition.  Applying the poison takes an action.  A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constriction savings throw or take 1d4 poison damage.  Once applied the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.
//''Ingredients:'' Various//

!Potions
Liquid form, taken by drinking.  One dose of potion affects one man-sized creature instantly.  Potions lose their affects in a day if left open or mixed with other things.

''Potion Of Healing (5g) __Common__''
Restores 2d4+2 points of lost hitpoints or, if health is maximum, restores a point of lost fatigue.  Repeated doses have full effect.
//''Ingredients:'' [[Red Amanita Mushroom]]//

''Potion of Greater Healing (10g) __Uncommon__''

//''Ingredients:'' [[Red Amanita Mushroom]]//

''Invisibility Potion (500g) __Very Rare__''
This potion's container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid.  When you drink it, you become invisible for 1dx10 minutes. Illegal in many places.
//''Ingredients:'' [[Invisible Stalker]] Eye//

''Water Breathing Potion (11g) __Uncommon__''
You can breathe underwater for 1 hour after drinking this potion.  Its cloudy green fluid smells of the sea and has a jellyfish-like bubble floating in it.
//''Ingredients:'' Blood from a Magic Sea Creature, Jellyfish//

''Elixir Of Long Slumber (3g) __Common__''
Roll 5d8, if the drinker has hitpoints equal to or lesser than this number they fall instantly asleep.  The subject falls asleep for 1 minute or until they take damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap them awake.
//''Ingredients:'' Unknown//

''Potion of Flying (500g) __Very Rare__''
When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover.  If you're in the air when the potion wears-off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft.  This potion's clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.
//''Ingredients:'' [[Roc]] pinion feather//

''Potion of Growth (43g) __Uncommon__''
When you drink this potion, you gain the &quot;enlarge&quot; effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required).  The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts.  Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
//''Ingredients:'' [[Giant]] blood//

''Potion Of Fire Breath (23g) __Uncommon__''
After drinking this potion, you can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you.  The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed.  The potion has an orange flickering liquid, and smoke fills the top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened.
//''Ingredients:'' [[Fire Beetle]] gland//

!Unguents
A cream or jelly.  If touched, it sinks into the skin, taking immediate effect - so a dose of unguent on a weapon or doorknob will only affect the first person to touch it.  Lasts a week if exposed to air, neutralized by water.

''Alchemist's Fire (5g) __Common__''
This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air.  As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact.  Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon.  On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns.  A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguise the flames.
//''Ingredients:'' Fire Elemental Ember, Oil//

''Oil Of Fire Protection (7g)''
Subject is fireproof, as per the lowest level of Resist Fire [M37] for 1d hours. Requires 3s in materials; 1 week.

''Cream Of True Sight (13g)''
Gives power to see auras, as per the Aurua spell [M53], for 1d minutes, applied to eyes.  Requires 2s materials, 4 weeks, -1 to skill.

''Oil Of Slipperiness (2g)''
Makes a surface slippery as the Grease spell [G79].  Anyone stepping onto the surface must roll DX - 3 as they enter each hex.  Failed roll means they fall down.  Another DX - 2 is required to stand up.  All combat is at -3.  Last 2d minutes.  1g in materials, 1 week to make.

''Keoghtom's Ointment (12g)''
Can be swallowed or applied to skin, removes poison or cures disease, and restores 2 points of HT.  Only one dose per day will be effective.  2g in materials, 4 weeks to create, -1 to skill.

''Oil Of Sharpness (7g)''
Makes the subject weapon do extra damage when it hits.  Increases basic damage by +2.  Can be applied to a sword, or 10 missiles (arrows).  Requires 10c of materials; 2 weeks to create.

''Universal Solvent (15g)''
Dissolves anything it is applied to, except living matter.  Wrapped in fresh leaves, which will last for 1 week.  Requires 2s in materials, 4 weeks to make, -2 to skill.

''Sovereign Glue (8g)''
Bonds any two things together permanently, takes 1 minute to set.  Must be stored in a vessel coated with oil of slipperiness.  1s in materials, 2 weeks to make.

''Brewed Reek''
Animal musk, spoiled meat, pungent plants, and any other foul-smelling substances on hand go into a batch of brewed reek.  When boiled, this mixture becomes a thick alchemical slime that adheres to anything it touches  You can hurl brewed reek as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet.  A creature stuck with a direct hit must succeed at a DC 15 Constitution save or be sickened for 2d6 rounds.

''Black Fester''
This black paste is often applied on [[Orcish|Orc]] weapons before going on raids to stymie an enemy's healing magic.  Like a poison, black fester stays on a weapon until the first time it strikes an opponent.  It remains in the target's body for 1 hour.  A creature exposed to black fester resists magical healing; a caster trying to magically heal the target must make a DC 10 check to be able to have the spell take effect.

!Powders
Solid form.  Powder must be eaten in food, or dissolved in drink, to be effective; takes effect in 2d minutes.  Powders can last a long time: there is only a 50% chance, each year, that a given powder will lose its power while exposed to air.  Powders mixed with food or drink will last a month.

''Dust Of Dryness (12g)''
Makes 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust.  Each pinch turns 1 hex of water into a marble-sized pellet, whose weight is negligible.  When the pellet is smashed against a hard surface, the pellet shatters and the water is released.  Requires 2s in materials, 3 weeks.

''Dust Of Disappearance (60g)''
This powder resembles very fine sand.  There is enough for one use.  When you throw it into the air, you and each creature and object within 1 hex of the thrower become invisible for 1dx10 minutes.  Requires 10g in materials, 16 weeks, -3 to skill. Illegal in many places.

''Dimmer Dust''
A powder made from faintly radioactive ore, with extra reagents used to activate the dust.  When used, dimmer dust must be sprinkled in a 5-foot square, which then becomes the center of the dust's effect.  All bright or normal light within 30 feet of the activated dust is reduced to dim light, and any creature attempting to cast a spell related to light inside this area must first succeed a DC 15 check or have the spell's effects negated.  If dimmer dust is exposed to moisture, it immediately becomes permanently inert.

''Flash Powder''
This coarse gray powder ignites and burns almost instantly if exposed to flame, significant friction, or even a simple force such as throwing it against a floor.  Creatures within the 10-foot radius burst are blinded for 1 round unless they succeed a DC 13 Constitution check.

!Pastille
A thumbnail-sized tablet; should be kept in a sealed vial.  It is used by burning; it flashes to flame instantly when lit.  The smoke from a pastille will fill its hex and the 6 adjacent hexes to a height of 8 feet and linger for 10 seconds indoors (much less outdoors - possibly only a second).  Anyone in this area suffers the effects in 2d seconds.  To avoid being affected, hold your breath; you must not breathe //any// of the smoke.  This requires a roll vs HT if you expected the pastille, or a HT-3 roll if you were caught by surprise.  An unburnt pastille lasts a month if exposed to air, but is destroyed instantly if it gets wet.

''Tablet Of Luck (23g)''
Grants ability similar to the Luck advantage [B21] for 2d game hours.  Requires 2s in materials, 6 weeks.

''Poisonous Fog (8g)''
A poison, doing 4d damage; a successful HT roll reduces this by 1/2.  Symptoms include numbness and paralysis.  A second dose will not be effective until an hour after the first.  1s in materials, 2 weeks to make.  Illegal almost anywhere!

!Misc

''Tanglefoot Bag (5g)''
A small sack filled with tar, resin, and other sticky substances.  When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged attack) the bag comes apart and goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air.  A creature must make a DC 17 Strength Saving Throw or be restrained by the goo.  Alternatively, once 15 points of damage is made to the hardened goo, the creature is free.  The hardened goo becomes brittle and fragile in 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness.

''Night Tea''
This frothy tea made from the bone-white, triangular leaves of the night tea plat renders a humanoid female sterile if drunk every day.  In high doses, it may be able to end a pregnancy.</pre>

<pre>|![[List Of Alchemical Formulas|Alchemical Formulas]]|

''__Proficiency: Alchemy__''
Alchemy is the science of magical transformations and transmutations.  It is a mechanical process, using the [[Mana]] inherent in certain items.  Therefore, it can be studied and used by those without [[Magical|Magic]] aptitude.  In fact, magical aptitude confers no bonus to Alchemy skill.  It is treated like any science - it just happens that the subject is magical in nature.

!Making Alchemical Items
An alchemist must collect and learn recipes similar to how a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] collects and learns spells.  Learning from teachers and books is safer than experimentation.  Each alchemist defaults to knowing a number of recipes equal to their proficiency bonus; any other recipe requires use of reference books.  The player of an alchemist should make a list of the recipes their character knows.

Creation of alchemical items requires expenditure of a certain amount of money for materials, and a certain amount of time.  The [[recipe|Alchemical Formulas]] must &quot;cook&quot; without stopping for the number of hours specified within the instructions, with an alchemist in attendance for at least 8 hours daily.  It does not have to be the //same// alchemist every day - but if more than one share the tasks, the roll is made by the one of //lowest// skill.  The attending alchemist must pay full attention to his task; he cannot monitor two different batches at once!  The costs given are for one dose.  An alchemist can make a &quot;batch&quot; of several doses at once, just by using more materials; but his final skill roll is at disadvantage for every dose after the first, because larger batches are harder to control.

An alchemist's skill depends on the equipment he has to work with.  Improvised equipment (at minimum a fire, and clean containers) increases the DC to create by 10 (worse at GM's discretion); Home Workshop (A table and 5 [[gold|Currency]] worth of equipment) is no modifier to DC; Professional Lab (10'x10' room, 50 [[gold|Currency]] worth of equipment, much of it bulky and fragile) is +10 to DC.

//Success and Failure:// At the end of the required time, the alchemist tries one Alchemy Skill roll.  Each [[formula|Alchemical Formulas]] has it's own DC for success!  There is no &quot;critical success&quot;; the process works or it doesn't.  Ordinary failure means the materials must be thrown out.  On a critical failure, roll a Wisdom Saving Throw at DC 10. If the alchemist makes this second roll, disaster is averted.  A failure requires a roll on the Critical Alchemy Failure table:

| 17-20 | Everyone within one hundred yards suffers the effect of the elixir, or its reverse effect, 50% chance of each |
| 13-16 | Everyone within ten yards suffers the effect of the elixir, or its reverse effect, 50% chance of each |
| 9-12 | Explosion destroys lab; alchemist has time to flee |
| 5-8 | Explosion destroys lab; alchemist takes 3d damage |
| 1-4 | Explosion destroys lab, alchemist takes 6d damage |

!Inventing New Formulas
New formulas can be researched in the same way as new spells.  Even the most trivial would take four weeks to research, and require a roll at Alchemy with a DC prescribed by the GM.  More potent elixirs would take longer for each attempt, and the skill penalty would be greater.  The GM will probably be the source of most new elixirs.  A critical failure on a research roll sends the alchemist immediately to the failure table above.  If research is successfully completed, he has created one dost of the elixir, he can reproduce it and teach it to others.

<div title="Ammenon" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202004301333" modified="202012291858" tags="person" changecount="11">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/ammenon/ammenon.jpg]]
Ammenon was a [[Human]] from [[The Third Age]] (c. 3253 [[IO]] to 3199 [[IO]]) who leveraged [[Blood Magic]] in order to gain immortality and live another thousand years as [[The Whispered One]] until he was vanquished in 2127 [[IO]].

As a young boy, Ammenon grew up as a slave in the city of [[Nahajan]] in modern day [[Amon]] in what were called [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]].  He was the oldest of six children, where they and their mother lived in servitude to their master.  Their master was cruel and brutal, having worked Ammenon's father to death in the mines and beat Ammenon and his siblings relentlessly.  Ammenon's mother meant the world to him, and they shared a special bond.  Her death sparked an unending hatred inside of him, which he fed with the practice of [[Blood Magic]], which his mother dabbled in.

He used [[Blood Magic]] to summon a [[Dathairä]] named [[Vaecna]] to aid in the murder of his former master and free his siblings from slavery.  With his new found power and alliance, his desire was to right the injustices of [[Asha]] ending slavery and brutality forever.  However, bargaining with a [[Dathairä]] is tricky, and Ammenon became more corrupt through it's influence in becoming the first mortal to master [[Blood Magic]].  Ammenon was strong of mind and will, and soon saw [[Vaecna]] was just another master controlling him.

Using his newfound power, Ammenon raised an army and swept across [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]], showing no mercy to the former warlords as he subdued the land under his rule.  The final warlord to oppose him, [[Harmost Xawn]] was bested in combat by Ammenon himself; and for his punishment Ammenon broke his will and corrupted his mind; turning him into a faithful bodyguard, servant and slave.  A sign to all those who sought to exert their will over others.

Ammenon chafed at the influence of his new master, and hatched a plan to subdue the [[Dathairä]].  Ammenon invented a ritual to trap [[Vaecna]], and began a tedious process of corrupting and stripping the [[Dathairä]] of it's own sanity.  The process was completed through butchering [[Vaecna]] into parts.  Ammenon finished by replacing his own eye, hand, tongue, heart and blood with that of [[Vaecna]] - giving him the power of [[Truesight]], enhanced strength, the ability to charm, and premonitions of the future that prevented him from being surprised.  It failed to give him what he desired most: immortality.  He knew that his body would die, and the parts of [[Vaecna]] would live on.

From this point forward, Ammenon named himself Ammenon Vaecna - even though the consciousness of the [[Dathairä]] was no more.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Armondax/armondax.jpg]]

Much of Armondax's (47? [[IO]] to 26 [[AAP]]) early life is a mystery, however it is known that Armondax settled in an area now known as [[The Dales]].  There he lived a reclusive life inside of a tower in the wild areas of the realm.  He was fascinated with the ancient mysteries of the world, and his tome [[Treatise On Dragonkin]] is not only the first, but still considered the most complete document on [[Dragon]] anatomy and behavior.  In his research he uncovered the lair of and ancient [[Dragon]] named [[Culdranth]], and subdued him single handed.  During the arduous battle at least two hamlets were destroyed and a city nearly toppled.  This began the feud between [[Mysara]] and [[Armondax]], as [[Mysara]] found his use of [[Magic]] reckless and dangerous.

He was fascinated by the power of elemental fire, and was known as the Wizard of Brimstone.

When [[The Demon Plague]] began, [[Mysara]] sought out Armondax believing him responsible for the death and destruction occurring to the people under her care.  After a brief but powerful exchange of magical combat, the two realized a darker magic was to blame.  Together they combined their magical talents to battle the cult known as [[The Holy Scourge]].  After a series of conflicts, they sent word to both [[Fazar]] and [[Waywill]], two equally powerful mages - and together the four of them brought an end to [[The Demon Plague]].

While the group managed to avert an impending [[Desecration]] locally, [[The Destruction Of Uskard]] saw to a surge of [[Uskardeen]] refugees come to [[Kellos]].  The near destruction at the hands of [[The Holy Scourge]], and inclusion of the magically gifted [[Uskardeen]] saw [[Cyril Viridian]] take power and overthrow [[The Old Republic]].  [[Cyril Viridian]] began the [[Azutan Nagyos]], a war against [[Magic]].  During this time the four mages founded what is now known as [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].  Banded together they fought against [[Cyril Viridian]], self appointed [[Emperor]] of [[Kellos]].  After a few years of fighting, the [[Azutan Nagyos]] ended - and magic was no longer outlawed.

In the peaceful years that followed, Armondax fell in love and married his once rival [[Mysara]].  Together they had a son who was himself a powerful wizard.</pre>

A pesky weed whose original [[Elvish|Elvish]] name is Arrowana, or &quot;music weed&quot;, as the hollow stalks make melodious flutes and pipes.  Locals refer to it simply as Arroweed, since it grows straight as an arrow and is often as tough as one.  The weed has a brownish stem and a bushy conical head.  It often chokes other vegetation away due to its quick maturity and tendency to grow in thick clumps.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Athenaeum/artimas-meliger/artimas-meliger.jpg]]

Artimas Titus Warwick Vermillion Meliger (c. 975 [[AAP]] to Current) was a player character run by [[Brian Disbrow]].

Artimas Titus Warwick Vermillion Meliger of [[House Meliger]], [[Professor]] of [[The Athenaeum]], [[Arkanus]] Second Class, [[Constable]] of [[The Magian Imperium]], [[Archmage]] of [[Brand]] is often one for the dramatics.  As a young boy it was clear Artimas had a fondness for the study of [[Wizardry]].  He was fascinated how he could bend light to form artistic shapes to please his mother.  A native of [[Zylok]], he studied at [[The Athenaeum]] - a prestigious school for the [[magical arts|Magic]].  There he made a rival named [[Rolo Baptiste]], a young lad of noble birth.  To make matters worse, Artimas was not well off and needed to work in order to put himself through school.  Circumstances found him working for [[Rolo Baptiste]]'s father - and [[Rolo Baptiste]] found every opportunity to make Artimas's life difficult.  When his father was not around, [[Rolo Baptiste]] ordered Artimas around like a servant - cruelly commanding him to perform menial chores.  As a young teenager, Artimas found himself at a breaking point and attacked his long time bully, ending with Artimas falling and hurting his back from a botched casting of one of his [[Movement Spells]].  He was expelled from [[The Athenaeum]] around 993 [[AAP]].

He first traveled to [[Amon]] in the city of [[Candlekeep]] where he had a chance encounter with the [[Sorcerer]] [[Endymion Traxigor]].  It was this encounter that caused Artimas to create an illusionary manservant named Rolo.

He traveled [[Amon]] and [[Kellos]], extremely bitter.  Skilled at [[Illusion &amp; Creation Spells]], he would find solace in creating an illusionary manservant he affectionately named Rolo and would treat like dirt.  Artimas is extravagant, and dresses above his station.  He was present at [[Laranor]] [[First Light's Hope]] when [[Gavar Joro]] was murdered, spawning [[The Followers Of Joro]].  In fact it was [[Thermon Verik]] who sponsored Artimas into [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].  He spent time traveling with a group that included [[Erigol Dommi]] until he was called back to [[Zylok]] due to the death of his mother.

Upon his arrival in [[Zylok]], he was horrified to learn his mother was murdered; and her body was used in a [[Blood Magic]] ritual.  She was one of many in a spree of killings across the city.  Fueled by sorrow and rage, Artimas sought the perpetrator; accompanied by his old friend [[Salix Daelof]] (who was now a [[Professor]] at [[The Athenaeum]]).  It soon became clear that the killer was the current [[Keeper Of The Books]] at [[The Athenaeum]] library; [[Rolo Baptise]].  It would be incorrect to say that Artimas didn't feel pleasure in taking down his nemesis, and handing him over to [[The Magian Imperium]] where he was sentenced to death.

For this act, Artimas was raised to the status of [[Constable]] for [[The Magian Imperium]], had his expulsion from [[The Athenaeum]] removed from his record, and offered the position of [[Professor]] of [[Illusion]] by [[Nester Arkwood]].

He now finds himself as a [[Professor]] of [[Illusion &amp; Creation Spells]] at [[The Athenaeum]].  [[Headmaster]] [[Nester Arkwood]] finds it in slightly bad taste that Artimas's illusionary manservant is a caricature of [[Rolo Baptise]]; however most others see it as a befitting retribution.  Artimas is so transfixed upon himself and can be oblivious to the world around him.  Case in point, [[Penelope Kensington]]  actively flirts with Artimas unbeknownst to him.</pre>

!Adventuring Ideas
''Statue Garden'' - Rumors reach the coast that a hidden mountain valley holds a mysterious collection of statues.  The characters are hired to accompany a noble to investigate the nature of this strange observance, only to discover that numerous other parties have been already added to this display.

''Bring 'em Back'' - [[Talamin Raanan]] a [[Half-Elf]] assassin disappeared over five years ago, but spies report that she resides in a backwater town under the name [[Valemis Tirdra]].  One of the local constables wants to see her pay for her crimes, and hires the characters to capture her.  When the characters find Talamin, they learn that all she desires is to leave her violent past behind and live out her days with her new family, including her two young children.

''Chaos Companions'' - While the characters visit the city, they witness a noble drop dead as a creature bursts from her chest.  More nobles die in the same way as the characters investigate.  They eventually discover that the victims all visited the same brothel, an establishment run by a creature in disguise.

''A Friend In Need'' - The characters stumble onto a backwater village preparing to kill a woman half covered in black [[Dragon]] scales.  She is [[Calianna]], a unique [[Human]] [[Sorcerer|Sorcery]] with a [[Draconic Bloodline]].  She breathlessly describes a terrible cabal known as [[The Cult Of The Caustic Heart]] and requires the characters' aid in vanquishing it once and for all.

''A Book By Its Cover'' - A small group of [[Trolls|Troll]] have made a home in some local ruins.  When one of the young daughters in the town goes missing, [[Troll]] attacks increase.

The &quot;attacks&quot; are just the [[Trolls|Troll]] attempting to return the girl.

''Cave Of Fear'' - The characters are captured by cannibalistic tribals (big bald men with bodies painted black and faces white).  Death seems immanent, until they meet the &quot;queen&quot; who is regal and civilized.  She explains her brother &quot;the king&quot; and her were taken care of by the tribe.  She feeds them a glorious meal and apologizes for their treatment.  She explains they trespassed and violated a sacred burial ground, a taboo punishable by death.  They can earn their freedom if they retrieve the bones of the king; in The Cave Of Fear.  Another taboo place the tribals do not enter as it is covered in psychedelic slime that causes hallucinations (fear).</pre>

!Geography
[[The River Lethe]] courses through the lower planes.  The waters have the power to inflict amnesia and memory loss upon those that touch or drink of it.

[[The Central Pit]] is a massive crater-like hole that sits in the center area of Avernus and contains all of the lower circles of [[Baator]].  The view from the rim would no doubt be staggering if it weren’t the source of the toxic smoke that covers the sky on the rest of [[Avernus|The Circle Of Pride]].

[[The Bronze Citadel]] is a central power structure within Avernus.  This massive structure is forged entirely from metal, but so covered with thick layers of blood, ash and grime that it is difficult to tell.  It floats throughout the region, and is home to the ruler of Avernus, [[Shalekasha]]

[[The Wandering Emporium]] is a traveling bazaar that winds its way across [[Avernus]].  It is under the direction of [[Mahadi]], a [[Rakshasa]] that claims [[Gargauth Souldrinker]] as a patron.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Athenaeum/avix-ivumorn/avix-ivumorn.jpg]]

Avix Ivumorn (c 968 [[AAP]] - 1025 [[AAP]]) was a [[Wizard]] that specialized in [[Enchantment]] and magical equipment and was a teacher at [[The Athenaeum]] in the city of [[Zylok]].  He was born in 968 [[AAP]], to wealthy parents in the city of [[Zylok]] - and entered [[The Athenaeum]] as a student.  Throughout the years that he studied, he struggled to find a school of [[Magic]] that suited him.  He specialized in [[Conjuration]], as he had a desire to &quot;make&quot; things with [[Magic]]; yet he never was fully satisfied with the results he achieved.

As [[Headmaster]] [[Nester Arkwood]] rediscovered [[Echantment]], Avix became intrigued with the prospect of imbuing items with [[Magic]] and became [[Nester Arkwood's|Nest Arkwood]] assistant.  Since [[Nester Arkwood]] was far superior in the skill of [[Enchantment]], Avix struggled to contribute to the creation of the [[Arkstones]] which powered [[The Airship Triumph]].  However he did invent a technique named [[The Avix Link]] which allowed multiple [[Wizards|Wizard]] to contribute their [[Mana]] to the creation of an artifact.  This was instrumental in the invention of the [[Arkstones]]. 

Avix was the professor of [[Enchantment]], and the overseer of [[The Athenaeum's Maker Space]]; a place where materials are provided and available for Upper School students to experiment and invent with.  This space is focused on student centered inquiry, and often the place students use in order to complete their [[Student Independent Project]].

As [[Nester Arkwood]] had continued to rediscovering deeper secrets of [[Enchantment]], Avix had been struggling to keep up with the [[Headmaster]] - he found his knowledge eclipsed and he was often out of his depth.

He was slain in 1025 [[AAP]] during the events of [[The Black Night]].  He died heroically defending his students.</pre>

Azarad-Ji is an evil entity which wishes to lead the sentient beings of [[Asha]] astray, and bring about [[Desecration]].  Azarad-Ji is one of [[The Old Gods]], and possesses great power.  He is the most powerful and active of [[The Old Gods]].  The [[Larabira]] states that Azarad-Ji infiltrated [[The Void]], attacking [[The Gods]], severing the hand of [[Kombar]], and killing [[Valouria]].  At the end of the battle Azarad-Ji was imprisoned, protecting the world from his direct influences.  However his servants, the [[Dathairä]] are able to perform his bidding when in mortal form upon [[Asha]].

[[The Horn Of Azarad-Ji]] was presented to the most prominent of Azarad-Ji's soldiers.

Cultists who worship Azarad-Ji refer to themselves as [[The Chosen]] - believing they are special and singled out by their patron and will be granted immense power when their master eventually escapes from his prison.</pre>

<pre>In [[The Old Tongue]] Azutan Nagyos is translated to &quot;The War Of The Mages&quot;.  It was a conflict in [[Kellos]] that lasted between (c. 2 [[AAP]] and 4 [[AAP]]).  After [[The Destruction Of Uskard]] many [[Uskardeen]] took refuge in [[Kellos]].  [[Magic]] was running rampant, many fearing for their lives as those that would twist magic for their own gains were common.  [[Cyril Viridian]], banded an army together under the banner of Azutan Nagyos, to purge magic from the lands.

What is now known as [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]] was formed to combat the outlaw on magic, and [[Armondax]], [[Fazar]], [[Waywill]], and [[Mysara]] (all great wizards) pushed back against [[Cyril Viridian]] and his army.

The war lasted years, and abruptly stopped, and the ban on magic was lifted.  It is not documented as to why the war ended, however [[Cyril Viridian]] saw to the foundation of [[The Magian Imperium]] to govern the use of magic throughout [[The Viridian Empire]]</pre>

This new age will bring about peace in such a way that has not yet been seen: the lion will sleep with the lamb, and the creatures of the earth will cease to eat of the flesh of one another.

<div title="Bairn" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="201508022209" modified="202006232029" tags="race D&amp;D" changecount="31">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/bairn.jpg]]

The Bairn are a race of short cheerful humanoid creatures that rarely are above 4 feet in height or heavier than 40 pounds.  They are slender with pointed ears and in many respects resemble small human children, and as such are also referred to as Halflings, or Kinder (meaning child in [[The Old Tongue]]).  The males struggle to grow facial hair, clean shaven faces being the norm.  Full beards are rare, with some managing only stubble, goatees or mutton chops.

!Small And Practical
The Bairn survive in the world of larger creatures by avoiding notice.  They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothing; although some do prefer to favor bright colors.  Their practicality extends beyond clothing.  They're concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation.  Even the wealthiest of Bairn keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see.  They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.

Most Bairn live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves.  They rarely build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond what they need to subside.  They don't recognize any formal nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them.  They pride themselves on their traditions.  They are forthright, neighborly, non-threatening race, and most other people are fond of them.  The Bairn are not overly religious.  They are tolerant of the religions of other cultures, and tend believe that as long as things are going well the gods and religion are better left alone.  The Bairn make excellent innkeepers or restauranteurs.

!Unfazed By The Peculiar
The Bairn are curious folk, and love discovering new things.  In the world of the Bairn, everything is strange and as long as they don't bother the Bairn, the Bairn don't bother them.  They treat all strangers with courtesy, no matter how strange they are, as long as they are well-behaved.  The Bairn are unfazed by fear, but don't take kindly to those who are rude or rowdy.  Bairn are known to remain civil even when they are forced to violence.  This deep seeded wonder makes them adaptable to even the strangest cultures.  They are fun loving and can be tricksters, loving puns, games and pranks.  Their natural charisma and fondness of cultures makes them charming and delightful hosts.  They are also remarkably good at sniffing out frauds and humbugs.  Many a con man has gone away congratulating themselves on their success among the Bairn &quot;rubes&quot;, only to find later that they are the ones who came out on the short end of the deal.

!Hide The Valuables
The Bairn have a slight negative reputation with other [[Races]] for &quot;borrowing&quot; items and not returning them.  While this resembles Kleptomania, the Bairn simply are borrowing the item and have all intentions of returning it to it's rightful owner.  It would be in very bad taste to sell or make a profit from any borrowed item.  Any right minded Bairn would be offended if their borrowing was thought of as thievery.  Their curiosity extends into a love of magic, gadgets and strange items.

!The First Men
The Bairn occupied [[Kellos]] alongside of [[The First Men]].  Their original language, villages and culture is lost, as they have fully integrated and adapted to fit into [[Human]] society. 

!Names
All Bairn have both a personal and a family name.  First names are short and meaningless (presumably artifacts of the lost Bairn language) [eg Todo, Fastolph, Berilac, Skanlan].  Family names are usually meaningful in the local tongue, and are nature oriented (Thorntree, Hilltop, Redapple, Loamsdown).  A few very old families have equally meaningless family names (Maggo, Gilli, Kork).

<pre>|Governor:|[[Ariel Eulien]], [[Shield]] of Bandor, [[Marshall]] of [[The Green Sea]] and head of [[House Eulien]]|
|Population:|No census or taxes exist, but estimations are 23,500 to 30,000.  All races co-exist here|
|Fortifications:|50 mounted men are the local standing police force.  The police force is made up exclusively of volunteers.  They are usually well armed and armored, even when on patrol of the city.  They are often in plate and full helmet, and wield horseman’s flails, swords, and clubs.  A militia of 600 can be mustered in times of great need, mostly semi-trained citizens.  Bandor relies on its extreme wealth and influence, often ‘renting’ garrisons from nearby cities, or mercenary groups when serious defense is called for.  No city walls exist|
|Law:|Loose.  Trading would go elsewhere if the local laws were strict, so nearly anything goes.  No killing, no disrupting trading, everything else goes.|
|Resources:|Bandor is famous for its money lending, mercenaries, wagon repairs, riding mounts, and a thick black beer known as [[Bandorian Black Ale]].  However, they possess no self-sustaining resources.  The city trades for all necessary supplies.|

!Description
Bandor began as a trading hub, and eventually grew enough to be permanent.  The city remains a ramshackle scattering of tents and warehouses, yet has many interesting features. The town is home to many nightclubs, dancehalls, taverns and other wild forms of entertainment.  Nearly every carnal desire can be fulfilled in Bandor.  The town gets rather rowdy at night.  The city was founded near the broken ruins of the [[Elvish city|The Sylvan Empire]] of [[Velefanaefe]].

[[The Gauntlet]] is a group of [[Sellswords|Sellsword]] headquartered in Bandor.  [[House Eulien]] welcomes [[The Gauntlet]] within their city, due to the level of protection the group offers the city.  In times of need [[The Gauntlet]] will act as police or militia, at a very high cost to the city.  They are also known for guard duty of merchant caravans, or as personal bodyguards to the rich or nobility.

[[The Amphitheater]] is a central attraction to all who visit Bandor.  It is host to various forms of public entertainment such as plays or musical performances.  Most often talked about is the gladiatorial combats that are fought here.  The combats are held on the 10th day of every month.  Many attend, and the gambling is as savage as the fighting.

The city of Bandor mints a coin known as the [[Bandorian Thumb|BandorianThumb]] (also known as simply thumbs, or coppers).  The thumb is the lowest denomination of [[Currency]] in the realm, due the sheer amount of coins the city has minted in the past.

!Social Customs
*It is customary for the citizens of Bandor to be extravagant.  Expensive jewelry and clothing are worn by even the poorest fisherman.  The Extravagance of the townsfolk is so extreme, that even local shops offer free sweets to all who browse (often raising their prices to accommodate).  Those that actually are at the top of the social ladder do not dress to impress, not wanting to be caught up with the customs of the lower class.  Instead they dress rather modestly.   Their clothes are made from the finest cloths and silks, but they lack the over the top flair favored by the small-folk.

!Places Of Interest
*[[The Yellow Lion]] is well known for terrible food, watered down ale, and its excellent source for gossip and information.
*[[The Drunken Dwarf]] is a tavern that feels more like a cave than a building.  This is mainly due to the Dwarven proprietor.  He is as rough and jagged as his patrons, and normally joins in on any bar fights.  He always appears to be drinking more than his customers.
*[[The Dancing Bear]] is full of scantily clad dancing girls.  Here one can enjoy a good mug of [[Bandorian Black Ale]] while watching some of the most beautiful girls in Bandor dance.
*[[The Red Beard]] is named after its proprietor, [[Harlyn Bergun]].  He was once famous for being the best archer in [[Asha]] – who regulars say hasn’t lost his touch.
*[[The Amphitheater]] is the last of the [[Elvish ruins|The Sylvan Empire]] that stood here.  It is currently used for performances and public entertainment.
*[[The Order’s Rest]] is a inn and restaurant founded by [[Bishop]] [[Malar Ralm]].  This establishment is very tame and boring compared to the atmosphere in the rest of Bandor.  The serving girls here show the least amount of skin, and no rough housing is tolerated.  The patrons are watched carefully, and the proprietor (a local priest) is known to give sermons to all those forsaken souls that call this place dull

!Adventuring Hooks
''Victory Breakout'' - Several monsters are freed from their confines in [[The Ampitheater]].  These monsters - an [[Abominable Yeti|Yeti]], a [[Hydra]], and a [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]], and others tear through the streets leaving carnage in their wake.  Did these monsters escape by themselves or did someone else free them to distract the guard and characters while another crime took place?</pre>

The first [[Human]] minted coin was the Bandorian Thumb.  The thumb is made of copper, and bears the official seal of [[Bandor]] (an open hand) on both of its faces.  The thumb’s official name is the ‘Bandorian Copper Piece’, however it receives its common name due to its low value and extremely high circulation.

Barnabus Diggle is a [[Professor]] at [[The Athenaeum]] who teaches [[Cantrips]] to all of the new first year students.  He is an extremely old [[Half Elf]] at over 170 years of age, and his age has made him incompetent in anything other than the most simple spells (However Barnabus sees himself as important, and does not see the opinion others have of him).  He is hard of hearing, bad of sight, and many first year students end up taking advantage of his kindness and leniency.

Barnabus's [[Wizard|Wizardry]] [[Familiar]] was an owl he named [[Maximus]], who faded away back to [[The Feywild]] over 70 years ago.

As a young student in [[The Athenaeum]], Barnabus had a friend named [[Fenwick Vendergeist]], a fellow [[Half-Elf]] who still lives within the city of [[Zylok]].  The two stay in constant contact, using spells to chat with each other every night.  As a young lad, Barnabus was quite the athlete.  He broke two school records as captain of a [[Spellflag]] team, and a plaque of his achievement still stands in [[The Athenaeum's|The Athenaeums]] library - much to the student's amazement.</pre>

The Black Pearl is the name of the currency of the [[Elves|Elf]] of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  They are small round pebble-like stones with a glossy black finish, and an engraved [[Elvish]] rune signifying the [[city|Cities Of The Sylvan Empire]] it was minted in.  The material that comprises the stone is unknown, and the art of the minting technique is lost.  These stones are extremely old, dating back to soon after [[The Elvish Awakening]].  No matter their age, all Black Pearls look as if they were minted yesterday.  No deterioration is apparent and they are essentially indestructible.  It is very rare to find Black Pearls in circulation due to how much they are prized and hoarded by the rich.  The existing [[elves|Elf]] will have nothing to do with their currency from their past, and are actually reviled by it.  All money is considered taboo to both [[Elven|Elf]] cultures, and their societies trade exclusively with barter.</pre>

|![[Click Here For A List Of Blood Magic Rituals|Blood Magic Rituals]]|

Blood Magic (also commonly known as Azaradian Ritual Magic) draws energy from within the very life essence found within living creatures; or in some cases the very essence of the caster themselves.  Casting Blood Magic incantations takes a physical toll, with some of the energy remaining residual behind within the caster.  This residual energy begins to manifest itself as Corruption.  This Corruption grants access to more powerful incantations but at a steep price.

Blood Magic is a skill that can be taught and learned, even easier than [[Wizardry]].  While the more powerful rituals are delicate and fickle, some rituals are easy enough to be followed like a recipe.  However for most, the practice of Blood Magic is not only considered dangerous, but evil - as many of the rituals require great sacrifice to feed the desired outcome.  Performing and participating in Blood Magic rituals brings about Corruption, which take a great physical toll on the body and mind.   

!Corruption
Using Blood Magic frequently leaves traces of the powerful force inside of the user, granting them access to more powerful incantations but at a price.  Each [[Blood Magic Incantation|Blood Magic Rituals]] that is completed causes a Wisdom saving throw to be rolled.  The DC of this saving throw is outlined below, and is dependent on the character's current Corruption level and power of the incantation.  On a failure, the character suffers 1 point of Corruption.  When a new tier of corruption is achieved (e.g. Mild to Moderate, Moderate to Severe), roll a d12 on the Corruption Effects Table below to determine the effect of that character's corruption.  Corruption effects are cumulative with previous effects as higher tiers are achieved.  If a character reaches 12 or more Corruption points, the DM decides whether or not the character dies instantly, or goes insane and becomes an NPC under their control.  A character with 12 or more corruption points cannot be brought back to life or restored to player control until they are brought below 12 corruption points.

|! | !No Corruption (0 Points) | !Initial Corruption (1 Point) | !Mild Corruption (2 Points) | !Moderate Corruption (3 - 8 Points) | !Severe Corruption (9 - 11 Points) | !Dead / Insane (12+ Points) |
| !Save DC (Power 1 Incantation)| 10 | 12 | 12 | 14 | 18 | - |
| !Save DC (Power 2 Incantation)| 12 | 14 | 14 | 18 | 22 | - |
| !Save DC (Power 3 Incantation)| 14 | 18 | 18 | 22 | 25 | - |

!Corruption Effects
Many of the following corruption effects carry some form of mechanical detriment, but the real fun is being aware and weaving them into narrative and roleplaying scenarios.  Consider how some of these effects might alter a social encounter, or adjust the character's reaction to a particular event.  Don't be afraid to remind the player of their corruption should a moment arise where they may have an opportunity to incorporate it.

| !d8 | !Initial Corruption | !Mild Corruption | !Moderate Corruption | !Severe Corruption |

| 2 | Bruises | Seeping Sores | Scent Of Decay | Withered Flesh |

<pre>Borbata is an [[Uskardeen]] fighting style and a method of close combat against an armed or unarmed opponent in which one uses no weapon or only a short weapon.  As striking an armored opponent proves ineffective, this style uses joint locks, pins and throws to neutralize an enemy.  The concept is to use the opponents own force against them. 

''Borbata - (Physical Hard)''
This represents the skill in the martial art, and allows the character to learn the maneuvers of this style.  Additionally, you may parry with either of your hands as if it was a weapon using 2/3 your skill.  Any unarmed attacks you make do increased damage, add 1/5 your skill, rounded down, to your damage.  Any time you punch an armored foe with DR 3 or better, roll vs HT.  A failed role means you take 1d-2 damage.

''Arm/Wrist Lock''
You can twist an opponent's limbs, paralyzing or crippling him.  First, you must either successfully parry an attack in hand-to-hand combat (this //can// be a weapon attack, if the foe is no more than 1 yard away) or make a Grapple (using DX, or Borbata skill).  If you succeed, you grab one of the victim's arms.  //On the same turn//, roll a Quick Contest, your Arm Lock skill vs his DX, Wresting or Judo skill (whichever is best).  If you win, you have trapped his arm in a lock.  The attacker may indicate the particular nature of the lock (i.e. behind the foe's back, his arm extended from his side, etc).  You for may try to break free; use Arm Lock+4 or ST or Judo in another Quick Contest.  If you win, you have immobilized the arm; the victim can try to break free in subsequent rounds, but at a cumulative -1 penalty.
On the next turn, you may choose to inflict pain or damage on the trapped limb.  A third Quick Contest (Arm Lock or ST vs HT) is required.  The victim is at +3 if he has the High Pain Threshold advantage and your intention was only to cause pain.  If you win, you inflict one point of damage or //pain// (Causing DX and IQ penalties without actual damage) for every point by which you make the roll.  if you do crippling damage, you break the arm and hand you were holding; no further damage can be inflicted; but all further attempts to cause pain are at +3!  The arm lock counts as torture on an Interrogation roll [B66].  The victim must also make a Will roll minus the damage infliced, or drop any weapon he was holding in that hand.  Of course, if the hand or arm is crippled, any weapon held by it is automatically dropped.
Furthermore, other attacks may be infliced on the victim.  Close Combat attacks can be used against someone held by the lock; the victim defends at -4, in addition to any other penalties caused by the damage or pain cause by the lock itself.
Typically, a stick or [[Tonfa]] is used in conjunction as a lever to inflict an Arm Lock.  Use the rules above, except that the attacker uses the weapon skill.

''Disarming (Hard)''
This maneuver allows an unarmed man to take an attacker's weapon.  The defender must have successfully parried the weapon attack, or must grab the foe's weapon arm, as per [B111], substituting Disarming for DX.  On the next turn, a Quick Contest between Disarming and DX is necessary to remove the weapon.  A failure means the attacker keeps the weapon; a critical failure means a hit on the hand!  For weapons that have disarming capabilities, replace Disarming with the appropriate skill.

''Borbata Parry (Special - cannot be improved)''
The Borbata skill includes training in subtle footwork and evading blows.  This maneuver allows the character to guide a foe's attack away from or past himself, effectively allowing him to dodge the attack.  This still counts as a Parry, not a Dodge, and the character is still limited to his usually number of parries per turn.  Contact is not required but it is common, and this parry //can// be used to initiate an Arm Lock or Throw, or any other maneuver that can be initiated with a Parry.  Unlike a true Dodge, this parry cannot receive bonuses from Acrobatics or Boxing, nor may it be used against ranged weapons.  This maneuver is granted at no extra cost.

''Throw (Special - cannot be improved)''
This maneuver is described on [B51].  A martial artist may also inflict damage with the throw.  A thrown foe, if the attacker wishes, will take 1d-2 damage.  A successful throw at -6 to skill will result in the victim falling on his head, taking that damage to the brain.  A successful Breakfall roll will avoid this damage.  This maneuver is granted at no extra cost.</pre>

!Description
Brand is an ancient city, even predating the founding of [[The Viridian Empire]].  It stands next to a significant waterfall in [[The Kelerion River]], and straddles the cliff face with ports on both the upper and lower sections of the river.  A mechanical elevator allows cargo to be shifted between ports, making Brand a bustling city that acts as a trading hub for [[The Stone Lands]].  Resources from [[Skoras]], [[Dorin's Mine]], [[Hillcrest]] and [[The Dales]] are brought to Brand to make their way to [[The Fisher's League]] and then out to sea.  Brand is an ever expanding city, with a new section built across the river connected by a bridge that is considered to be one of the most monumental undertakings of the modern age.  Directly outside of the walls are the villages of [[Pyxis]] and [[Gramm]].

!Social Customs
* Each year the founding of Brand is celebrated.  All of the commoners in the city drink, and partake in a contest known as the battle of the boasts.
* The wealthy in the city build their villas in a square, such that the center is open to the sky.  Inside is traditionally a garden and pool.

The [[Kell]] believe that there are those among them that walk in shadows, and dance in the night.  They refer to these creatures as Burgonya.  While just stories the old wives tell the children, every story is similar.  Sightings of half-man half-animal forms that prey on hapless [[Humans|Human]].  They are grotesque to the eye and nose, have strength and speed beyond normal abilities.

The stories also say that the Burgonya lead normal healthy lives in the light of the sun.  Only on special nights will a person transform into a bestial Burgoya.  Often the Burgonya will not even know of his bestial form.  Their evil disease grants them unholy rest while in their beast form.

The tales commonly tell of wolf forms, but other rare stories can be found with Bear, Seal, Leopard, Boar, Ape, and Bat Burgonya.

Finally, the Kells tell of the Burgonya’s infectious bite.  It is said that those bitten by a Burgonya will themselves become one, or if one is lucky, they will die.</pre>

Caldoria was a continent that existed up until [[The Second Desecration]], comprised mainly of reclusive [[Dragonborn]] and their [[Tabaxi]] slaves.  Before the events of [[The Second Desecration]] the [[Dragonborn Elders]] witnessed a foul taint spreading across [[Asha]] - a world ending calamity that caused them to protect [[Caldoria]] from destruction. Using powerful [[Magic]] long forgotten, they submerged their major cities beneath the ocean where they believed the touch of [[Desecration]] could not reach.  [[Dragonborn]] civilization lived undisturbed and isolated for countless years under magical domes that kept the dark cold water at bay - until [[The Lifting]] in 1021 [[AAP]] where the cities returned to the surface of the ocean.

Cities of Caldoria include [[Anmanu]], [[Kunusut]], [[Annofu]], [[Sasu]], [[Ekru]], [[Nekkhapata]], and [[Ansapis]].  Each of the cities are on interconnected islands with the exception of [[Anmanu]] which floats high above in the sky propelled by ancient [[Magic]].

[[The Guardian Of Caldoria]] is a large lobster shaped leviathan that lives beneath the ocean surrounding the islands.  It is ancient in design and construction - a mix of metal and flesh similar to the process undergone by [[The Children Of The Forge]]</pre>

!Description
Candlekeep is known by several names, one of which is &quot;The Floating City&quot;.  This is due to the fact that the city consists of over 100 small islands connected by numerous canals and bridges.  Some of the buildings are built upon wooden platforms that are supported by stakes driven underwater to reinforce the construction.  There are tensions between the local inhabitants and a large group of refugees from [[Caldoria]] that are comprised of [[Tabaxi]].  The [[Tabaxi]] do not know the language and are poor, surviving by roaming the streets and living within dark alleys.

!Social Customs
* [[Panathenaea]] - is celebrated each year to honor the harvest and [[Umwe]].  The local [[Sorcerer]] [[Endymion Traxigor]] has elevated the holiday by offering trinkets to the locals in place of animal sacrifice.  This holiday is held above all others within the city of Candlekeep.

He he betrothed to [[Carmila Volkos]], a marriage of convenience rather than love.  He has an air of formality about him that causes others around him to be formal as well.  He owns the largest fleet of shipping and fishing vessels within [[The Risen Reef]].  An [[Elvish|Elf]] manservant named [[Driane'eire]] served his family for generations.  But during [[Panathenaea]] in 1025 [[AAP]], the [[Draugaira]] [[Elf]] murdered three members of [[The Remnant]] and was seen no more.|

[[Carmila Volkos]] likes to do what she wants, when she wants - and knows she can always wriggle away from trouble with her looks, her status, or her money.

While [[Endymion Traxigor]] often causes trouble, his heart is in the right place and he means well.  His full power in [[Magic]] is unknown, but it must be significant if he has permanently transformed himself into the body of a [[Beaver]].|

[[Endymion Traxigor]] is unaware that [[Vibius Castinus]] dislikes him so - and often speaks fondly of their friendship. [[Vibius Castinus]] is a large man that always smells of lavender and sweet fragrance. |

The Catoblepas is native to the vile swamplands of [[Caldoria]].  It is a large lumbering beast resembling a cross between a [[Yak]], [[Buffalo]] or [[Warthog]] found in other parts of [[Asha]].  It is content in lazily wallowing in its marshy home, munching on vegetation and carrion.  It is roughly the size of two [[Horses|Horse]] with a bloated hairy body like a [[Buffalo]].  It has a long neck like a [[Giraffe]] and a head like a [[Warthog]] with yellowed tusks.

The [[Dragonborn]] of [[Caldoria]] have domesticated the creatures.  A dangerous proposition since Catoblepas have a noxious perpetual scent of death that can only be removed if it is regularly bathed.  The [[Dragonborn]] also blind the animal for their gaze causes necrotic damage.  This process of blinding the creature causes the domesticated Catoblepas to have cloudy milk colored eyes.  They use the creatures as beasts of burden to pull wagons and plow fields.</pre>

Caxton Loom (980 [[AAP]] - 1010 [[AAP]]) was a pirate of [[The Mummers]] within [[The Risen Reef]] of [[Amon]].  Known by the moniker &quot;The Bear&quot; due to his physicality.  Caxton was a [[Kell]] born in [[Kellos]] who found his way to [[The Risen Reef]] and joined [[The Mummers]] as a pirate.  His brutality was difficult to contain, and he was routinely chastised by [[The Salt King]] [[Garrad Stroud]] due to pushing the limits of the rules of [[The Mummers]].  In 1006 [[AAP]], Caxton was chastised for the final time; he killed [[Garrad Stroud]] and assumed the title of [[The Salt King]].  While [[Garrad Stroud]] was beloved like a grandfather to many in [[The Mummers]], Caxton saw him as weak and easily overpowered him.

As [[The Salt King]], Caxton Loom sought to abolish the code of [[The Mummers]]; he saw the rites of parley and the code of civility as antiquated.  Many of [[The Mummers]] took offense to these changes, and Caxton murdered them.  It was [[Rafail Kallides]] who eventually usurped him and returned [[The Mummers]] to their former glory.  After besting Caxton, [[Rafail Kallides]] used a [[Blood Magic]] ritual to raise Caxton as a [[Zombie]] loyal to him.  Runes tattooed across his face are remnants of the ritual which removed his soul.  He is a shell of his former self, a lapdog to [[Rafail Kallides]] who is kept as retribution for the damage he did to culture of [[The Mummers]].</pre>

<pre>Cenedriane (&quot;Twilight Breeze&quot; in [[Elvish]]) was a one of the most radiant cities in [[The Feywild]], seat of power and home to [[The Autumn Court]].  It was the site of the longest and most vicious battle with the [[Fomorians|Fomorian]], and has long since been abandoned and overtaken by wilderness.  The surrounding lands are dark twisted wilderness, haunted by terrible spirits.

The original city still stands as a cursed ruin.  At the city center, crystal towers stand empty and overgrown.  Creatures live in the hollowed out buildings.  Large shards of white stone buildings hang frozen within the air, where the cataclysm that destroyed the city left them.  [[Wild Magic]] surges are frequent, making it a dangerous place to visit.</pre>

The cockatrice is a grotesque lizard creature that resembles the head and feet of a bird, and the wings of a bat.  Their skin is reptilian in nature, with proto-feather protrusions.  It is famous for the venom found within its mouth.  Even the smallest scratch can spell doom, as once the venom makes contact with the bloodstream, the victim must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution save or be magically petrified.  On a failed save, they begin to turn to stone and are restrained, making another save.  On a successful save, the effect ends - on a failed save the victim is paralyzed for 24 hours.

Their diet consists of any small animals that can fit in its mouth, however they are fiercely territorial and aggressive.  They fly into the face of any threat, squawking and madly beating their wings as its head darts out to peck.</pre>

<pre>The Consul was the highest political office of [[The Old Republic]].  Two consuls were elected each year, serving together and possessing veto power over the others actions.  This lessened the ability for one factions to abuse the kingly powers this role bestowed upon them.  Election was performed by [[The Old Republic Senate]], who therefore would customarily elect a Consul from the ruling nobility.

The duties of the Counsul were to preside over [[The Old Republic Senate]], and see that the laws and decrees were carried out.  All other governmental roles were subordinate to the Consuls.  They also acted on behalf of the regions of [[Kellos]] in matters of state, such as negotiations with other nations such as [[Dwarf]] or [[Elf]].

In order to grant the Consul with greater authority at executing law, they had the power to summon, detain and arrest.  In times of great emergency, they had the authority to act on their own authority and responsibility.</pre>

<pre>!Introduction
[[Asha]] is abundant with different forms of currency and trade.  The [[wild nomadic tribesman of the northwestern territory|Kell]] use decorative strips of leather that they refer to as [[Cedula]]'s.  This simple form of currency is worthless outside of the [[nomadic people|Kell]] and is not recognized as a true currency of [[Asha]].  The [[Orcs]] are rumored to trade with teeth (taken from their fallen enemies).  Stranger still are the secluded island people of the western coast, who trade with small polished shells.  However, in the civilized lands only four major forms of currency are acknowledged: [[Bandorian “thumbs”|BandorianThumb]], [[Deepwater]] [[“Red Queens”|Red Queens]], [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] [[“Kombarian Eyes”|KombarianEye]], and Ancient [[Elven|Elf]] [[“Black Pearls”|Black Pearl]].

Cyril Viridian, (c. 61 [[IO]] - c. 11 [[AAP]]), was a [[General]], Statesman, and [[Consul]] of [[The Old Republic]].  [[Kellish|Kell]] blood flowed strong in his veins, being descended from the kings of [[The First Men]] to inhabit [[Kellos]].  He played a critical role in ending [[The Demon Plague]] and was outspoken against the perils of [[Magic]] and the impending doom of a [[Desecration]].

Was responsible for ending [[The Old Republic]] and establishing himself as [[Emperor]] of a new nation named [[The Viridian Empire]].  Once in power, he made swift social and governmental reforms - disbanding [[The Senate]], sponsoring the creation of [[The Divine Order]], changing the [[Calendar]], re-establishing hereditary rule, and most notably outlawing [[Magic]] through a move called [[Azutan Nagyos]], or &quot;War of the Mages&quot; in [[The Old Tongue]].

When the [[Azutan Nagyos]] ended, Cyril saw to the founding of [[The Magian Imperium]], a ruling body of mages who would set and enforce the laws on the use of [[Magic]] in the realms.</pre>

Cyrus Bryne is the official head of [[House Bryne]], [[Shield]] of [[Port Seamark]], and [[Marshall]] of [[The Coast]].  He is stern, ambitious, and politically astute.  Cyrus's goal is to see his [[house|House Bryne]] stronger and more powerful than he found it.

Cyrus has a familial relationship with the [[Emperor]] [[Jacob Jedaleon III]], in that Cyrus's aunt [[Freya Bryne]] was the [[Emeror's|Emperor]] mother.  At a young age, Cyrus was appalled that his cousin was treated special, as the only heir to the throne.  This grew to a silent rage due to an incident in which Cyrus was force to concede a contest of arms to his older cousin, as it would be unseemly to best the [[Prince]] [[Jacob Jedaleon III]].

Cyrus's mother [[Estrella Bryne]] was tough on Cyrus as a child.  She expected the best out of Cyrus, and was not against beating the child when her high standards were not met exactly.  Her punishments included kicking an 8 year old Cyrus out of the castle for days for defying her wishes, ruthlessly killing his pet falcon as a lesson for training it to be docile rather than a hunter, and commanding a teenage Cyrus to behead a criminal himself to understand his true duty and obligation as a [[Lord]].

Cyrus's father was a kind man who was simply the face of [[House Bryne]].  Everyone knew [[Estrella Bryne]] ruled the household.  His father died when Cyrus was 19, and his mother was quick to name him the head of [[House Bryne]].  Say what you must of [[Estrella Bryne]], but for her faults all she wanted was to see her son rule - and rule strongly.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/darkling.jpg]]

Be they the children of migrant [[Humans|Human]] seeking refuge in [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] kingdoms, or of [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] merchants who struck rich in the wide open world, the half-dwarves (more commonly known as Darklings) share a mix of traits from both of their parent races. Some say that [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] blood tempers [[Human]] impatience, while others say that [[Human]] heritage allows them to be more flexible than the stone.  The existence of Half-Dwarfs is as old as their ancestors, though less common. 

!Not Welcome In Either World
There is no taboo against [[Humans|Human]] and [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] breeding, but it is a very rare occurrence; this makes the Darklings misfits and outcasts.  Not feeling a sense of belonging in either community, they are known as [[Sewer Dwarves]] by the [[Human]] civilization, and [[Aalvtaurag]] of &quot;half beards&quot; by the [[Kombar''ran|Dwarf]].

!Their father's nose, their mother's eyes
To [[Humans|Human]], Darklings look like tall [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], and to [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], they look like short [[Humans|Human]]. They typically sit in the middle range of heights between their parents, although they're a little bulkier than the average [[Human]].

!Children Of The Underworld
It is common for Darklings to find work in the criminal underworld, as the race is downtrodden and are alienated by those [[Humans|Human]] and [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] who are more traditionalist in their thinking.  Because of the abject racism they experience, Darklings always expect trouble and know it is safest to protect oneself with armor and weapon when traveling in [[Human]] or [[Dwarvish|Dwarf]] settlements.  Certain situations must be backed up by force, and you will never know when someone will try and take advantage of you.  They have a distinct feeling that everyone else is plotting and scheming in the same way they are.

!Darkling Cunning
Darklings have to be cunning to survive.  They know how to manipulate situations to their advantage, with a mix of [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] greed and [[Human]] adaptability.  Darklings are notoriously tight-fisted, and generally acknowledged to be just as reluctant as [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] to part with their money.  They are tough bargainers and shrewd merchants, and often buy no more than what they need.  The only way to get a Darkling to part with a penny is to offer him a wager, most Darklings enjoy games of chance.  Anyone that is able to out-wit or get the best of a Darkling in a deal will earn his respect and that of other Darklings as well.  Often a Darkling will tell a good story of cunning, even if he himself was out witted.  

!The Gang Is Their Home
Darklings don’t labor or build strongholds of their own.  They consider themselves just a bit more clever than everyone else, allowing other races to toil maintaining civilization while the Darklings reap all of the rewards.  Darklings often form into [[gangs|Darkling Gang]] for safety.  A gang leader is called the [[Cloak|Darkling Cloak]].  Males do not necessarily dominate the [[Darkling Gang]], whoever is the most powerful and most cunning usually leads.  The [[Darkling Cloak]] is ultimately responsible for the actions of his gang, and they operate under his protection.  Gang members always give their [[Darkling Cloak]] a cut of whatever they steal or make.   If anyone ever fails the [[Darkling Cloak]], they are exiled from the [[Darkling Gang]].  The only way to return is to kill a rival of the [[Darkling Cloak]].  Darklings who betray the [[Darkling Cloak]] or rat on a gang member are hunted until they are killed.  The [[Darkling Cloak]] of a Darkling gang is a highly respected individual.  Their orders are carried out indiscriminately, and failure often has due consequences.  Some [[Cloak’s|Darkling Cloak]] are malicious and controlling, treating their [[Darkling Gang]] members as lackey’s or goons.  However most [[Cloaks|Darkling Cloak]] deal with their members as if they were family.  The leadership style of a [[Darkling Cloak]] varies from gang to gang, but all [[Cloak’s|Darkling Cloak]] realize that their power may be challenged at any moment.

All [[gangs|Darkling Gang]] have a distinct name and symbol, which they carry with pride.  Quite often, the most powerful of the [[Darkling Gangs|Darkling Gang]] within a [[Human]] city will operate above ground.  Those that do, often own legitimate businesses to use as a front for their underground operations.  These bold and crafty gangs are well respected among the Darkling community.

!Description
The city of Deepwater is a majestic sight.  The original city of Deepwater was encased within a city wall.  The town then grew too big, and a new city wall was built nearly surrounding the first one.  A new palace and temple were built, grander than the first.  The city streets are wide and clean, and nearly every window has a small window box with a flourishing garden.  Taxation is rather high for the citizens, but in exchange they get peace and prosperity under their gracious and fair [[Emperor]].

In 1025 [[AAP]], agents of [[The Whispered One]] attacked the city; known as [[The Black Night]].  A [[Dracolich]] named [[Gorgothuun]] killed the [[Emperor]] [[Jacob Jedaleon III]], and assisted in the theft of artifacts within [[The Temple Of The Divine]].

<pre>Desecration describes the intent of [[Azarad-Ji]] and his [[Dathairä]] to bring about the cataclysmic end of [[The Eternal Cycle]] and [[The Planes Of Existence]], and everything within it.  They desire the destruction of [[The Gods]] in order to gain ultimate power and control.  Multiple times Desecration was attempted only to be thwarted.

!The First Desecration
[[The First Desecration]] was brought upon by [[Humans]] of [[The First Age]] who used science to tear the dimensional fabric which released [[Azarad-Ji]] and his [[Dathairä]] from their celestial prison.  This nearly caused the extinction of [[Mankind|Human]].  While this belched forth creatures and forces beyond comprehension, full Desecration wasn't achieved due to intervention from [[The Gods]].

!The Second Desecration
Deep within [[The Second Age]], when [[The Gods]] and [[Azarad-Ji]] were locked in their eternal struggle for dominance, [[The Second Desecration]] began.  The [[Dathairä]] [[Vergadain]] unleashed [[The Primordials|Primordial]] within [[The Fountains Of Creation]] upon [[Asha]]; these giants rained destruction upon the world and distracted [[The Gods]] enough for the armies of [[Azarad-Ji]] to gain an advantage.  This Desecration was prevented by [[The Gods]] by winning the war and imprisoning [[Azarad-Ji]] once again.

!The Third Desecration
[[The Sylvan Empire]] and fell to the same hubris as the [[Humans|Human]] of [[The First Age]].  Despite being children of [[Lucian]], their greed allowed some among them to be corrupted; thus began [[The Third Desecration]].

Desini Oswin (c. 990 [[AAP]] to Current) was a player character run by [[Erin Disbrow]]

Desini grew up on the outskirts of the city of [[Riverdale]], in the village known as [[Wayfaire]], located in the heart of [[The Dales]].  She was born to [[Oswin Orosco]], a [[Priest]] of [[The Divine Order]] and [[Kalia Orosco]].  At age 16, Desini and her father desperately tried to protect the village from a sudden fire that put everyone at risk.  The fire claimed the life of many, including [[Oswin Orosco]] as well as blinding Desini with the toxic fumes from the apothecary.  Blind and despondent from her father's tragic passing, Desini was left with her mother [[Kalia Orosco]] and younger sister [[Lyla Orosco]].  Desini's blindness made her a burden to her mother, who had to work harder than ever to support the three of them.  One day she met [[Magnus Zizorum]] - a mage as handsome as he was powerful.  His charm got the better of her, and Desini convinced her sister to run away with him.

[[Magnus Zizorum]] had great power to enchant and beguile as well as power over life and death itself.  He gave Desini her vision back, by making a pact with a [[Dathairä]] named [[Draizon]].  This improved her vision greater than it was before - coloring her eyes a purple hue, and granting her the power to cause fear to those she looked upon.  Soon after, [[Magnus Zizorum]] and her sister [[Lyla Orosco]] fell in love and had a baby.  When Desini learned of [[Magnus's|Magnus Zizorum]] plans to sacrifice the child using [[Blood Magic]], Desini plotted a failed attempted to escape with her sister.  During the ritual, Desini stole the baby (who grew to become [[Erik Doorhaus]]) and ran to [[The Grey Companions]] for assistance - who launched a mission to kill [[Magnus Zizorum]].

A decade later, Desini rejoined with [[Erik Doorhaus]] and [[Minerva Carrington]] in the city of [[Brand]] to join [[The Grey Companions]].  She led the exepedition beneath the [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] [[Stronghold]] of [[Kulkar]] and retrieved the evil artifact known as [[The Horn Of Azarad-Ji]].</pre>

!Commune With Yurtrus
|''Casting Time:'' 1 minute|
|''Range:'' Personal|
The caster sees through the veil of reality to pose a single question to the [[Dathairä]] [[Yurtrus]], who will answer a single question regarding those that have passed.  Questions such as when they died, or the manner of their death are appropriate.  [[Yurtrus]] is not all-knowing, and will only answer in &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; or &quot;uncertain&quot;.
The ritual requires a blood sacrifice equivalent of 1d6 damage either from the caster or another living creature.

!Glimpse Of Truth
|//''Required Components:'' [[Mordayn Vapor]].//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 minute|
|''Range:'' Personal|
After inhaling [[Mordayn Vapor]], the caster reaches out to a nameless malevolent [[Dathairä]] that exists beyond normal consciousness to pose a question related to [[Dathairä]].  Examples include questions about possession, [[Dathairä]] motives or influence on the mortal world, [[Desecration]], or specifics about an individual [[Dathairä]]. The question must be posed such that the answer is a simple &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; or &quot;uncertain&quot;.  Answers the DM deems too obscure are never revealed.

!Kandar's Farsseer
|//''Required Components:'' A living creature from the sea or water.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 10 minutes|
|''Range:'' Touch|
|''Duration:'' 1 minute|
The caster uses the power of [[Kandar]] to envision a specific location or item and its surroundings.  Offering must be of a fish or creature of the water, freshly killed with entrails removed and placed in a circle.

!Mirror Sending
|//''Required Components:'' A mirror of finely wrought and highly polished silver costing no less than 40 gold.//|
|''Casting Time:'' See Text|
|''Range:'' See Text|
The caster sends their image through a mirror into another mirror or reflective surface that the chosen target looks into.  The caster casts the spell, then stares into their mirror until the target sees their reflection, or until the caster tires and gives up.  The caster can see the subject and their surroundings in their mirror whenever the subject looks at their surface.  From the subject's perspective, the caster appears to be staring out of the mirror, replacing the subject's own reflection or appearing right behind them (caster's choice).  The caster can have their image say up to one word per caster level before it disappears, if they choose.  The image remains for only 1 round.  Subjects not expecting a mirror sending can be greatly unnerved by this spell.</pre>

To be blessed with Divine Favor is to be a conduit of the power of [[The Gods]].  Those so imbued with this power are capable of petitioning [[The Gods]] for miracles, and abilities of great healing.  [[The Gods]] don't grant these powers to anyone who seeks them, only to those who have devoted themselves to a higher calling.

Harnessing this power does not rely on study or training like [[Wizardry]], nor is it an innate talent one is born with like [[Sorcery]].  One learns the ancient rites and prayers and is granted the ability to cast spells based upon an intuitive sense of the deity's wishes.  Those who stray from their devout path could see their powers diminish or be stripped away completely.</pre>

These reptilian monsters have six legs and a sluggish metabolism that only allows a slow movement rate.  It can fly, but only for short periods.  A dracolisk is usually dull in color, with eyes that have a pale glow.

Along with a bite and claw attack, dracolisk posses a gaze that enables them to turn any fleshy creature to stone within 30 feet.  Petrified prey are consumed using a caustic saliva that is able to partially reanimate the flesh enough to chew and digest.

<pre>[[Sorcery]] Bloodline
See 5E Players Handbook page 102

Your innate magic come from your blood or that of your ancestors being mingled with [[Dragons|Dragon]].  For the [[Dragonborn]], this can be attributed to a [[Dragon]] based lineage; for other races, this can be achieved through a bargain with a [[Dragon]].  It is rare for [[Races]] other than the [[Dragonborn]] to have this bloodline, as [[Dragons|Dragon]] are fickle and see others as lesser than them.  Those that are of this bloodline bear the mark of the [[Dragon]], with scales covering large portions of their body.

!Dragon Ancestor
At 1st level, you choose one type of [[Dragon]] as your ancestor.  The damage type associated with each [[Dragon]] is used by features you gain later.

|!Dragon|!Damage Type|
|Black|Acid|
|Blue|Lightning|
|Brass|Fire|
|Bronze|Lightning|
|Copper|Acid|
|Gold|Fire|
|Green|Poison|
|Red|Fire|
|Silver|Cold|
|White|Cold|

You can speak, read, and write [[Draconic]].  Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with [[Dragons|Dragon]], your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

!Draconic Resilience
As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your [[Dragon]] ancestors to emerge.  At 1st level, your hit point maximum is increased by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.  Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of [[Dragon-Like|Dragon]] scales.  When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + Dexterity modifier.

!Elemental Affinity
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your [[Draconic|Dragon]] ancestry, you can add your Wisdom modifier to one damage roll of that spell.  At the same time, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

!Dragon Wings
At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of [[Dragon]] wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed.  You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn.  They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.  You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

!Draconic Presence
Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your [[Dragon]] ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened.  As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60-feet.  For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura muse succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends.  A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.

There are many species of Dragon, however they all share a common set of traits.  They are reptilian in nature, consisting of a large serpentine neck, quadrupedal and bat-like leathery wings.  They are warm-blooded magical beings that appear to have some connection with [[Mana]].  Dragons are egg layers, and most specimens have horns, teeth and claws.  They grow rather rapidly as they mature, and books tell of ancient specimens nearly the size of a [[Human]] village.  Dragons possess a natural intelligence and all dragons have the ability to speak.

Like many large predatory beasts, dragons have enhanced senses.  They have infravision, granting the ability to see body heat as well as a discriminatory smell that can distinguish familiar scents.  Their abilities make them an apex predator.  Dragons are fiercely territorial and require large periods of hibernation, otherwise their disposition would have made it difficult for sentient life to peacefully thrive in [[Asha]].  Hatchlings sleep on average 15 hours a day (around 66% of their existence) - however as dragons age they begin to enter into cycles of alertness and hibernation.  Younglings modify their behavior to 8 months of activity (with roughly a [[Human]] style sleep schedule of 8 hours a day) followed by 4 months of deep hibernation.  During this time, the youngling often buries itself underground to seek protection.  The need for hibernation grows as dragons age, with ancient dragons being known to hibernate for years or decades.

Dragons are thought to be one of the oldest races to ever exist.  They have a racial memory that grants them experiences from their elders.  This is a passive ability that comes and goes in waves.  This may be what drives their insatiable obsession with collecting and controlling knowledge and puzzles.  Draconic self worth and position is classified by both age and their collection of arcane or unobtainable knowledge.  However with their hoards of knowledge, there is no greater secret than to the reason as to why they are a dying race.  Dragon births are rare, with many eggs do not hatch.  The oldest of the species feel a tug or longing that mysteriously has them fly into the very darkness of space never to return.

[[Shadow Dragons|Shadow Dragon]] are Dragons who have been born or spent a large amount of time with plane known as [[The Shadow Lands]].

!Known Dragons
[[Culdranth]] - an ancient dragon who was subdued by [[Armondax]]
[[Erseirriog]] The Voiceless - a dragon killed by [[Appius Liberalis]]</pre>

The Dragonborn arrived on [[Asha]] sometime after [[The Cataclysm]] and during [[The Second Age]].  Dragonborn are taller and heavier than [[Humans|Human]], standing well over 6 ft tall and averaging 250 pounds.  They lived on a secluded island continent known as [[Caldoria]] with their [[Tabaxi]] slaves, cautious of the world beyond the sea.  The [[Dragonborn Elders]] foresaw the coming of [[The Second Desecration]], and sank the civilization to the bottom of the ocean.  In the year 1021 [[AAP]], the island cities were raised once more to the surface of [[Asha]] in an event known as &quot;[[The Lifting]]&quot;.  While rare outside of [[Caldoria]], they are now found anywhere in [[Asha]].  There are countless configurations of frills and horns, and some Dragonborn are born without a tail.

!Proud Clans
The Dragonborn have lived in a strict [[Caste System|Dragonborn Caste]] for [[ages|History]].  This system dictates those Dragonborn with tails (known as Draconians) are thought to have families of purer blood, and are of higher status than those without (known as Ravinites).  Non-Dragonborn are called [[The Unseen]], and are of the lowest rank.  Dragonborn come in ten colors: Gold, Silver, Bronze, Copper, Gold, Red, Blue, Green, White, and Black.  Metalic and Chromatic colors live together in harmony - and do not confer personality or temperament.

!New To Asha
The Dragonborn are still relatively new to [[Asha]], having lived in isolation under the ocean for the most of [[The Fourth Age]].  They remain reclusive, and carefully guard their culture, secrets and wealth from other races.  Many Dragonborn are fierce, and courageously passionate with sharing their thoughts - but respectful of those in power, and believe lineage and age determine one's position in society.

!The Forged
The Dragonborn have a specialized form of [[Magic]] and Industry that allows the bravest among them to undergo experimentation that melds their flesh with metal in a ritual they call [[The Children Of The Forge]].  This ritual is secretive and permitted to be undertaken only by those Dragonborn who are purest of blood.

!The Scaled Gods
Having been removed from [[Asha]] for so long, it is more common for the Dragonborn to worship [[Tiamat]], [[Bahamut]], and [[Tyrnus]] the [[Dragon]] gods of Chaos, Order, and Balance.

__Noble Caste -  The //Orders Of Gold, Silver, Copper, Brass, Bronze, Red, Black, White, Green, and Blue //__
The Noble Caste is the highest within [[Dragonborn]] society, believed to have stemmed from a bloodline that is most strongly connected to their [[Dragon]] ancestors.  Each member of the Noble Caste has a tail at birth.  Each color has their own organization known as an Order (e.g. &quot;The Silver Order&quot;).

__The Martial Caste - The Khalivar__
The Martial Caste trains in weapons and fighting.  They earn their rank through soldiering, or as a seasoned [[Gladiator]] in [[The Draconian Fighting Pits]] - which allow a path for those of any race to rise to the prestige level this caste confers.

__The Working Caste - The Dominvian__
[[Dragonborn]] who are skilled artisans, or have practice in [[Magic]] or [[Divine]] talents

__Common Caste - The Ravinites__
[[Dragonborn]] born without tails are not considered pure of blood and take roles of servants and undesirable jobs.  They rank only slightly above [[The Unseen]].

Draizon is one of [[The Old Gods]] made up of an enormous mass of tentacles, slime-dripping mouths and lidless eyes.  Small creatures are continually spat forth by the monstrosity, which are either consumed into Draizon's miasmatic form or escape to some monstrous life elsewhere.  Draizon lurks deep in [[The Abyss]] and rarely contacts the mortal realm.  Patient, yet unpredictable; Draizon does not plot and scheme - instead content to only exist, destroying and killing in order to consume, grow and thrive.  

Draizon has no gender, and is described in texts as a &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, and &quot;it&quot;.  However &quot;it&quot; is most appropriate, as Draizon is one of [[The Old Gods]] - existing before [[The Gods]] and before [[Asha]].  Draizon has power over the flesh, as Draizon itself has never stopped growing and expanding.  

!The Dark Young Of Draizon
The Dark Young Of Draizon, also known as [[Otyugh]] are horrifying, grotesque bulbous creatures with bloated bodies, thick snake like tentacles that end in spikey, leaf-like appendages used to shovel food into its gaping maw.  They plod along on three sturdy legs, but are more content to wait in ambush in mounds of detritus and carrion, leaving only a sensory stalk exposed.  They smell putrid like rotting flesh.

The creatures are usually called upon to preside over cult ceremonies.  One means of summoning them is found in [[The Book Of Mig'dran]] and requires a blood offering.  Cultists have been able to extract what is called [[The Milk Of Draizon]] from these creatures - granting those that drink fierce and dark mutations.

!Worship
An active cult of Draizon exists, led by an ardent worshiper named [[Ariadnah]], an [[Uskardeen]] woman who is said to be 600 years old.</pre>

[[Zezebazum]] entered the court in the guise of healer to tend to the king.  He spun lies to [[Nethitine Elanathi]], making him believe his twin brother was wicked and cruel.  [[Zezebazum]] wrongly convinced him that his father was not [[Longing Of Kalara]], but instead poisoned by [[Una'Unti Elanathi]] in an attempt to seize the throne for himself.  Changing form into the twin brother, [[Zezebazum]] poisoned [[Nethitine Elanathi]] during the impending struggle.  Poisoned, bloody and dying, [[Nethitine Elanathi]] was enraged.  Yet again in the form of the healer, [[Zezebazum]] comforted [[Nethitine Elanathi]], and informed him that the poison was ancient and evil.  He claimed that drinking his rival's blood would be an antidote, however there would be grave consequences.  Healed enough to stand up and seek revenge, [[Nethitine Elanathi]] ignored [[Zezebazum]] and his warnings, responding that he would deal with the consequences once his brother lay dead.

Drinking the blood of his brother sealed him to [[Azarad-Ji]], and turned him into the [[Kiraga]] he is today.  Now he is known as [[Dego]], and is cursed to stalk the night and seek blood for survival.</pre>

!Description
Drellin's Ferry is one of the few safe passages across [[The Nenakessana River]].  The spot was known to the [[Kell]] as Drellinsild (or Dwarfbridge in [[The Old Tongue]]), as the river was once spanned by a sturdy [[Dwarf]]-made bridge at this spot, as a means to connect and trade with [[The Sylvan Empire]] in the previous [[Age|The Third Age]].  Prior to [[The Amoni Invasion]] the bridge washed out in a great flood.  A few hundred years ago, an enterprising man named [[Dayson]] hammered together a small horse-drawn ferry to maintain a river crossing here, and a town eventually grew up around the enterprise.

!Social Customs
*On 1/25 the town celebrates [[Evermeet]], a day honoring love and unity.
*The town holds a festival on 3/25 celebrating the final harvest.  There is music, dancing, and a large pig is roasted in an open pit.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/darkones/drelmor.jpg]]

Drelmor was the first child and most beloved of [[Azarad-Ji]].  A strong, fierce and loyal [[Dathairä]].  He commanded [[Azarad-Ji's|Azarad-Ji]] armies before the creation of [[Asha]].  His soldiers feared him as much as their feared [[Azarad-Ji]].  In the name of [[Azarad-Ji]], Drelmor infiltrated the realm of [[The Gods]] armed only with his massive blade.  He along waded through scores of soldiers for [[The Gods]], slicing them in two with his great sword without a second thought.  His sole purpose, to get to [[Umwe]].  He carved a path to [[Umwe's|Umwe]] feet - and with a great strike blinded [[The God|The Gods]] forever.  In the ensuing chaos, he escaped victorious.  [[Azarad-Ji's|Azarad-Ji]] forces eventually lost to the heavenly host and were subdued with [[Azarad-Ji]] and his children frozen within a celestial prison.

Drelmor was the first to awaken during [[The First Desecration]], and quickly freed his creator and siblings.  They raged across [[The Planes Of Existence]] corrupting all life they came in contact with.  Drelmor led the [[Dathairä]] in battle once again in [[The Second Age]], bringing ruin to [[The Planes Of Existence]] wherever his armies marched; butchering [[AstraKashira]] by the score, removing their prized wings before torturing and killing them.  He bathed in their blood.

Drelmor was eventually defeated by [[ImoMahtara]], a common foot solder of the [[AstraKashira]] with [[The Spire Of Planes]] - eradicating both of them from existence. </pre>

The Drengi (translated to &quot;Slayer&quot; in [[Dwarvish]]) are rare and thought to the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] to be stories of myth and legend.  They stand on four of its six legs, towering up to 7 feet in height.  The other two legs, armed with wicked spikes, are used to seize and hold prey.  The Drengi lashes out with both forelegs, grabbing its victim.  Treat this as an attack at 1-hex reach that grapples if the victim loses the Contest of [[Dexterity]].  Once having grapples its victim, the Drengi begins to feast, generally biting its prey on the neck first to kill it.  The forelegs do crushing damage on the turn it grapples.  Breaking free from the grapple requires either a successful Contest of Strength or doing enough damage to cripple the limbs.  The Drengi will usually bite only after having grappled its prey.

The Drengi come in a variety of colors: white, black, grey, red and purple.  This color appears to signify some rank or meaning to their hierarchy within their hive.  They do possess a form of raw intelligence, but one that has no respect for the life of other creatures.  They are pure evil, living in nests under the command of a single powerful queen.  The Drengi are parasitic, implanting eggs within living hosts.  Hatchling Drengi consume the host, taking on some of the host's characteristics.  When a Drengi hatches from a host capable of [[Magic]], they also possess the means to cast spells.</pre>

Dretched are one of the evolved forms of [[Soul Larvae]] found in [[Baator]].  They resemble small rats with a face resembling that of the [[Human]] soul that they once were.  They spend eternity in disappointment, wallowing in the filth of [[Baator]].

While an evolved form, they are repulsive and considered vermin amongst the creatures of [[Baator]].  They lack anything that could be significantly regarded as brainpower.  They are cowardly with a strong self-preservation instinct necessary for survival in the harsh environment in which they live.

The three of them joined together with Drold's cousin to go treasure hunting.  During the adventure, [[Lommy Loamfoot]] died at his cousin's hand - and the two [[Darklings|Darkling]] left [[Minerva Carrington]] to die.  However [[Minerva Carrington]] made it back alive, and counts Drold as a mortal enemy.  Drold finds this humorous - and takes pride in the title.  He has secretly had a romantic interest in [[Minerva Carrington]] from the time they were children in [[The Warrens]]. He enjoys teasing [[Minerva Carrington]] and finding subtle and non violent ways to impede her success.  Deep down, he sees himself reconciling with her and proposing.

Upon returning to [[Brand]], Drold began a career as a hired thief - and improved his social status greatly.  He enjoys luxury, as he was deprived of it when living in [[The Warrens]].  He likes to dress beyond his means, and act just as flamboyant.  He is boastful and a braggart.  He is often heard boasting that he taught [[Minerva Carrington]]

|![[Click Here For Information on the Dwarvish Language|Dwarvish]]|
The Dwarves, or as they call themselves the Kombar’Ran, live most of their lives underground in the rocky belly of [[Asha]] known as the [[Underdark]].  They are short, sturdy, and about 1½ feet shorter than a [[Human]] of equivalent strength and 50 pounds heavier.  Their features are broad and short, but their heads and torsos are nearly the same size as a [[Human’s|Human]].  Kombar’Ran have thick hair that usually is brown, black or red, though white or blonde are not uncommon.  Kombar’Ran wear thick, full beards which they grow down below their waists.  They wear practical, sturdy clothing, and are often in armor when outside of their home territory.  Dwarves live around 350 years, and therefore the oldest among them remember a much different world.  This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as the [[Humans|Human]] lack.

!Children Of Kombar
The Dwarves are a creation of [[Kombar]], set upon [[Asha]] to care for the resting place of [[Valouria]].  Their loyalty to [[Kombar]] is unwavering, and their society is built upon the [[Mordmarr'Khan]] or &quot;The Undermountain Papacy&quot;.  The Dwarves happily toil at their caretaking of the stone of [[Asha]], while simultaneously preparing to defend it from evil for the glory of [[Kombar]].  While the Kombar'Ran are often greedy and miserly, they have strict morals of justice passed down from their elders.  Rarely will a Kombar’Ran resort to theft or swindling.  However, they have no problem forcing other underground races from their homes in order to expand their territory or gain better mines.  After all, they are the rightful owners of the [[Underdark]].

!Renowned Craftsdwarfship
Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder.  They delight in labor, and take great pride in their crafts.  They mine the earth and build their homes within. [[Other races|Races]] see the Kombar’Ran as moody and greedy, most of their lives are spent happily working, singing and drinking. Kombar’Ran are respected craftsman and trade their goods with all the noble races of Asha.  The quality of their goods is unmatched and this usually makes them expensive.  They are also shrewd businessmen and tough bargainers.  Kombar’Ran will never pay more for an item than what is deserved.

!The Uuplaund
All Dwarves suffer from a racial fear of open spaces, or Agoraphobia.  They have lived their lives in the confined spaces of the [[Underdark]] and are unerved when there is no ceiling above their head.  Much like a [[Human]] in a cave will feel as if the walls are closing in, Kombar'Ran believe that without a solid ceiling overhead, they will fall 'up' with nothing to keep them on [[Asha]].  They call the surface of [[Asha]] [[The Uuplaund]].  Any Kombar'Ran found outside of the [[Underdark]] will need to have conquered this fear, as a [[Human]] spelunker conquers claustrophobia.

!Clans And Kingdoms
The Kombar’Ran regard their homes and families as sacred. All the dwarves are extremely loyal to their clan and [[Stronghold]].  Any Kombar’Ran would come to arms during an invasion (including women, children, and the infirm). The most basic social institution within their society is the clan.  An average Kombar’Ran clan is made up of 35 to 50 adult dwarves and 15 to 30 children, spanning 4 or 5 generations.  The clan is lead by the eldest among them.  Dwarves cherish their clan identities and affilitations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestor's names in oaths and curses.

!The Stone Blessed
Some Kombar'Ran are born with an innate talent for [[Sorcery]].  Those with this talent are called the [[Volg'gogan]] or &quot;Stone Blessed&quot;, and are seen as a deadly contingent of a [[Stronghold's|Stronghold]] defense - possessing both might and [[Magic]].  This ability is a power granted from [[Kombar]], and any children at the age of 15 who possesses the gift are removed form their [[Dwarvish Clan]] and enrolled under the care of [[The Undermountain Papacy]].  Being a [[Volg'gogan]] is one of the highest honors in [[Dwarvish]] culture.

Eiddoel Earthhammer III (912 [[AAP]] - Current) is the current [[Dorn]] of [[Kulkar]].  Son of [[Eiddoel Earthhammer II]], brother of [[Dargay]].  As a young boy, he admired his elder brother [[Dargay]] for his leadership and skill with words.  Over time, their father began to show signs of age and began to squander the city's fortune through bad business dealings and was soon a mockery among merchants and neighboring trade cities.  The citizens of [[Kulkar]] began to speak the end of Earthhammer rule of the city; which had existed since its founding.  [[Dargay]], the eldest son, challenged his father to step down in 932 [[AAP]] resulting in an angry exchange where [[Dargay]] was exiled from [[Kulkar]].  Eiddoel III was only 20 years old, young for a [[Dwarf]] and now the only one to hold his father in check.

Eiddoel III's father began a steady mental and physical decline.  Along with being mocked by those who dealt with him, he struggled to even perform basic tasks like feeding and dressing himself.  Eiddoel III stood by his father, tending to his every need in place of servants.  He sought to hide the embarrassment of a [[Dorn]] who could not tend to himself and protect the Earthhammer legacy.  All of this time, he put up with his father's confusion, delusion, disorientation, forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, and inability to create new memories.  His father was belligerent, and showed his son no gratitude or pride; except for one instance where in a foggy stupor confused Eiddoel for his brother [[Dargay]] and was so thankful for his return and apologized for his mistake of exile.  

Eiddoel III's jealousy that he harbored for his brother [[Dargay]] grew to exponential bounds during this time.  His brother was out experiencing [[Asha]], pretending to be a hero; while he was stuck tending to an old fool.

In 943 [[AAP]], [[Eiddoel Earthhammer II]] passed away and returned to the stone; many called it a mercy.  For many of the years prior, Eiodel III was the de facto reagent due to his father's mental state; it was natural for him to assume the throne despite it being his brother's by rite.  The [[Kestaz]] at the time, [[Vardrada Orebender]] while privately administering funeral rites for the late king made it clear to Eiddoel that she disapproved of him assuming the throne.   She felt his young age was enough to contest; and would end the Earthhammer reign.  Eiddoel was the only one present over his father's body when she made this claim.  She then was found at the bottom of the cylindrical shaft, apparently having committed suicide by falling 38 floors; her body was unrecognizable but her clothing was clearly distinguishable.  The next day, Eiddoel Earthhammer III was crowned [[Dorn]] of [[Kulkar]]..

He is cunning, proud and shrewd.  He is self important, and surrounds himself with opulence and signs of wealth.  The [[Earthhammer Clan]] is a ancient one, and the original founders of [[Kulkar]] - and [[Eiddoel Earthhammer III]] demands the respect his office and lineage deserves.  Rumors abound that it was him who killed his father and the previous [[Kestaz]], but they are spoken only as whispers else they reach his ears and bring his wrath - which is unbounded.</pre>

Elderon Eulien is the twin of [[Ariel Eulien]].  She is 8 minutes older (a fact she hangs over him any chance she gets).  He has an unbreakable bond with his sister, and while she acts as the head of [[House Eulien]] and [[Marshall]] of [[The Green Sea]] in all official purposes - she shares the burden of rule with him.

Like his twin sister, he is ruthless, cunning, and politically astute - traits valuable to one of the richest [[Houses Of The Viridian Empire]].  Elderon is fascinated with the arcane and dabbles in [[Magic]].  He is also quite practiced in the use of a [[Kahedafa]] or [[Elvish|Elf]] longsword, and has been taught the skill of [[Kaethu]].</pre>

While they share much in common, there are multiple types of Elves.  They are most identifiable by their unique culture, practices and beliefs.

!A Timeless Perspective
While Elves do not age, older Elves are known to suffer from what is known as the [[Longing Of Kalara]], a deep yearning to return to [[The Fields Of Kalara]] an be reunited with those they have lost, as well as their goddess [[Lucian]].  Being immortal provides a broad perspective on events that might trouble shorter-lived [[Races]].  They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy.  They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance.  When pursuing a goal however, they are relentless.

!Innate Sorcery
All Elves are born with an innate [[Sorcery]].  This manifests as a set of cantrips at their disposal.  Birth of an [[Elf]] baby is a rare event, and even more rare are the [[Achasiono]] (translated as &quot;unnatural&quot;).  This is the name given to an [[Elf]] born without the natural ability of [[Sorcery]].  Usually, these children are a bit odd and are cast out of their [[Havens]] by the [[The Emerald Order]] out of fear of their unusual traits.  Therefore, many [[Achasiono]] lack the basic racial traits that are integral to the wood elf.

!Fey Ancestry
All Elves have an otherworldly connection to the [[Fey]].  This grants them a connection to their creator, [[Lucian]], as well as a magical resistance to [[Glamour]].  Due to their connection to the [[Fey]], elves don't need to sleep.  Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hour a day.  While they meditate, they dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.  After resting this way, they gain the same befits that a [[Human]] does from 8 hour of sleep.

| [&gt;img[images/races/forana-lolo-kashira-preview.jpg][Forana'loloKashira]] |__[[Forana'loloKashira]]__ are Elves that live deep in Forest [[Havens]].  After the fall of [[The Sylvan Empire]], they gave up life within their cities - seeing their exploration of [[Magic]], Art and Science as inherently dangerous.  They strive to be a passive force on the planet of [[Asha]], to avoid the possibility of contributing to another [[Desecration]]. |
| [&gt;img[images/races/variona-sha-preview.jpg][Variona'Sha]] |__[[Variona'Sha]]__ are nomadic Elves that live in the eastern plains of [[Kellos]].  They are considered savage and fierce warriors.  Their hatred for the [[Orc]] and [[Troll]] races are fanatic - and they hunt and kill them in ruthless abandon.  The [[Variona'Sha]] coexist with the other races, and are often the face of the Elves - as the [[Forana'loloKashira]] are reclusive and indifferent to the events of [[Asha]] |
| [&gt;img[images/races/drow-portrait.jpg][Draugaira]] |__[[Draugaira]]__ are Elves native to the continent of [[Amon]] who were hunted to near extinction near the end of [[The Third Age]].  Those few that persist have grown cruel and militant at being driven from their rightful place on [[Asha]], and see the [[Human]] race as a bitter rival.  Once beautiful surface dwellers like their brethren, they forsook the light and found safety in the dark but dangerous recesses of [[Asha]] - changing their race forever. |</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/elvish-language.jpg]]
The Elvish language is both arcane and mysterious to outsiders, who equate the beautiful language akin to raindrops falling softly on smooth stones.  The [[Elves|Elf]] refer to their spoken word as the [[Efe]], or song.  Elvish still has a foothold in [[human civilization|Human]] as the root derivative of ancient names and places.  Often these names leftover of [[Elvish society|Elf]] have a transitive meaning to the [[humans|Human]], and are only kept for their esoteric value.

The language consists of 22 letters (5 vowels, 17 consonants).  The other unusual element in Elven language is the milanu, written as two small dots placed over the last vowel in the word.  All words end in vowels, the milanu makes the word plural.

!Guide To Pronunciation
Pronunciation is simple.  Pronounce A “ah” as in father, E “ay” as in weigh, I “ee” as in marine, O “oh” as in no, and U “oo” as in true.  Each vowel is pronounced separately.  Consonants mirror their English equivalents, with the exception of S.  When S is followed be E it is pronounced as if it were a Z (selle the Elvish word for nest is pronounced zella).  The consonant R should be trilled.  Vowels are never doubled.

!Common Sayings and Phrases
[[Kahedafa]] - &quot;dancing sword&quot; - a form of sword common in [[The Sylvan Empire]]
[[Gwainaira]] - &quot;New Child&quot; - an [[Elf]] born after [[The Third Desecration]]

<pre>This is a [[Sorcery]] background explaining your innate connection to [[Mana]].  Your ancestry can be traced to the [[Elves|Elf]].  You share their innate connection to [[Asha]] and [[The Eternal Cycle]] itself.

''Expanded Repertoire:'' At Level 1 you gain three more spells that are &quot;known&quot;.

''Twist Of Fate:'' At Level 6 you can twist fate using [[Wild Magic]].  When a creature makes an attack roll, ability check or saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a 1d4 and apply it to the creatures roll (as a bonus or penalty).  You must complete a short or long rest (or expend 2 sorcerer points) to use this again.

''Deeper Connection:'' At Level 6 your connection with [[Mana]] strengthens, and instantly gain an extra 1 sorcerer point.  When using sorcerer points to create spell slots using &quot;flexible casting&quot;, it is now possible to cast any valid spell for that slot within the list of sorcerer spells, even if you are not familiar with it.  Doing so is dangerous, and forces a roll on the [[Wild Magic]] table.

''Mana Manipulation:'' At Level 14 you possess the ability to manipulate [[Mana]] itself.  Using an action, you can cast Dispel Magic at will.  You must complete a short or long rest (or expend 3 sorcerer points) to use this again.

''Spell Bombardment:'' At level 18, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies.  When you roll damage for a spell and roll a 1, you may roll the die again.</pre>

<pre>The creation of a [[Magic]] item is a lengthy, expensive task.  To start, the creator must have a formula that describes the construction of the item.  The character must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must be able to cast any spells that the item can produce.  Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum determined by the item's rarity, as shown in the included table.

| !Rarity | !Creation Cost | !Min Level |
| Common | 10 gp | 3rd |
| Uncommon | 50 gp | 3rd |
| Rare | 500 gp | 6th |
| Very Rare | 5,000 gp | 11th |
| Legendary | 50,000 gp | 17th |
//Cost to create are halved for consumable items such as potions and scrolls.//

A character engaged in the crafting of a magic item makes progress in increments of gp equal to their level.  This assumes an 8 hour working day.  Thus a 10th level [[Wizard|Wizardry]] would complete an Uncommon item in 5 days.  To complete larger works, or complete tasks faster, assistants can be used.  Assistants must also meet the requirements for creation of the item (having the pre-requisite spells and spell slots).  They add their level to the daily increment same as the creator.

The GM makes the success rolls when creating a magic item.  Upon completion of the work,

<div title="Endymion Traxigor" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202101301530" modified="202101302254" tags="person" changecount="10">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Notable People/Amon/bronze/endymion-traxigor.jpg]]
Endymion Traxigor (age unknown) is a [[Sorcerer]] in the city of [[Candlekeep]] on the continent of [[Amon]].  He was born a [[Human]] male, but found his personal identity and species did not correspond with what he was born.  It took quite some time, but eventually he realized his true self was that of a [[Beaver]].  Endymion shape-changed into this form after encouragement from a teenage [[Artimas Meliger]] around the year 993 [[AAP]].  [[Artimas Meliger]] encouraged Endymion to live out ones inner feelings and desires, and to be true to oneself.

Endymion believes he is beloved by all of the people of [[Candlekeep]], but in truth he is a bit of an unintentional rascal.   He is so self absorbed and content in his [[Beaver]] form, that he is oblivious to the destruction he may cause.  Endymion is known to chew wooden fences and posts, free caged animals, or cut off water supplies by building random dams.

The local custom of [[Candlekeep]] is to celebrate [[Panathenaea]], a celebration of the harvest.  Traditionally, each family would sacrifice an animal as a token to the bounty.  Endymion was horrified by the senseless slaughter of innocent animals, and went about changing this practice.  As if a talking [[Beaver]] warning the townsfolk against killing animals wasn't enough, he also enacted a practice of delivering gifts to the locals who listened to his warnings.  This later grew to staggering proportions.

Endymion has an [[Enchanted|Enchantment]] pouch he calls [[The Pouch Of Offering]] which when wood or stone is placed inside, it can craft simple carvings.  The longer raw materials sit inside of the pouch, the higher the quality; if left long enough they may even possess a temporary magical quality.  Each year, Endymion uses this pouch to deliver gifts and has effectively replaced the celebration's connection to animal sacrifice.

It isn't often that Endymion travels into town, instead relying on his faithful [[Goblin]] servant [[Avidar]] to run errands.  When he does go into town, he can be seen peering into shop windows and has been accused of copying design ideas for [[The Pouch Of Offering]] from local artisans.  He is also known for loosing caged or fenced animals that he misinterprets to have gotten themselves trapped on their own and are in need of assistance.  Endymion is unaware of a nemesis named [[Vibius Castinus]] a [[Patriar]] who is a local soap maker.  The pine aroma of one of the specific soaps attracts Endymion, who loves the scent.  [[Vibius Castinus]] has found on multiple occasions [[Beaver]] fur within the pine soap, and accused Endymion of ruining the batch costing [[Vibius|Vibius Castinus]] money and customers.  Even though Endymion is known to cause mischief; all of it is unintentional and he is blind to it.

Endymion prefers not to wear clothes other than an ornate cape adorned with animal embroidery on its edges.  He is a very proud [[Beaver]], and he walks with the gait of royalty; his cape flaring out behind him.  Endymion has a flair for the dramatic, and prefers when attention is on him.  His fur is golden brown, lustrous, and well groomed; his teeth perfectly trimmed and sharp.  It is known that he manicures his claws so that they don't click on the ground when he walks.

Inside of the city of [[Candlekeep]] is an open wooded park known as [[The Candlekeep Prominade]].  It is within this area that Endymion lives, in a natural beaver dam that is on the small stream located here.  While the outside holds the appearance of a natural damn (if you ignore the chimney), the inside is quite cozy and appeals to the former [[Human]] within him.</pre>

Entar Arkstaff (992 [[AAP]] - Current) was born to Slaves who died making a coin in [[The Ampitheater]].  Even as a child, it was clear that Entar was special - for he possessed an innate ability with [[Magic]]; but one he couldn't control.  His family has no history of [[Sorcery]], and his [[Wild Power|Wild Magic Bloodline]] comes from an [[Unknown Source|Wild Magic Bloodline]].

Erik Doorhaus (c. 1008 [[AAP]] to Current) was a player character run by [[Tyler Disbrow]].

Erik Doorhaus ([[Dwarvish]] for Iron Hammer) was born to [[Magnus Zizorum]] and [[Lyla Orosco]] during a dark [[Blood Magic]] ritual meant to kill Erik to prolong the life of [[Magnus Zizorum]].  Erik was rescued from the ritual by his aunt, [[Desini Orosco]], who brought him to [[The Grey Companions]] for aid.  Erik was hidden, and an intense battle ensued in which [[Magnus Zizorum]] was presumed dead.  Erik was then raised by [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] in the underground stronghold of [[Kulkar]].  At a very young age, Erik showed great potential in the magical arts of [[Sorcery]] - especially fire magic.  Living underground with the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], he could use his magic to see in the dark - or light up objects and rooms to make his stay comfortable.  Using his [[Magic]], Erik helped his [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] father at their blacksmith shop.

His dwarven parents [[Ulrich Doorhaus]] and [[Sigge Doorhaus]] loved him dearly and saw to his upbringing.  Without an adequate teacher, Erik consumed many books on the subject of magic and the occult.

When he reached the age of 12, his size and power were great enough for the clan leaders to suggest conscripting him into the militia.  [[Ulrich Doorhaus]] protested strongly, as Erik was still but a boy and was not near the age of ascension.  Conflict ensued in which [[Sigge Doorhaus]] was killed, and [[Ulrich Doorhaus]] was imprisoned - but not before he was able to see Erik safely to the surface with provisions.

Erik found his was to the city of [[Brand]], where he met up with [[Minerva Carrington]] and [[Desini Orosco]] and joined [[The Grey Companions]].  Erik grew to become the most powerful mage in [[Brand]], experimenting with all forms of magical arts such as [[Enchantment]].  He was the creator of what he called a [[Haven Bag]], which was a bag that could magically store contents larger than its interior as well as [[The Chrono Ocullum]] which was able to contort [[The Eternal Cycle]] itself.

}}}
[[Eidolon]], or less formally &quot;Familiars&quot; are spirit companions that are summoned by a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] that take the form of an animal.  A [[Wizard|Wizardry]] has a bond with their Familiar; they can learn to communicate telepathically, use their senses, as well as cast some spells through them.

!Spirits From Beyond
Familiars are spirits from [[The Shadow Lands]] or [[The Feywild]], yet they arrive in the form of a common animal such as a Toad, Cat, or Ferret.  In rare occasions, the spirit arrives in its natural form of a creature from [[The Feywild]] or [[The Shadow Lands]].  It is possible to use [[Magic]] to alter the form of the Familiar, but it's natural state is that of what it arrives in when the [[Wizard|Wizardry]] first summons them.

!A Strong Bond
The bond between a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] and their Familiar is strong, each being an extension of the other.  This bond can never be broken once created.  Each can sense the other, and knows when they have died or have been hurt, and generally can sense the direction the other is in.

When a Familiar is reduced to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form.  The Familiar is not technically dead, and instead returns to its natural Plane of origin, awaiting to be summoned once again by the bonded [[Wizard|Wizardry]].  However, it is possible for a Familiar to die of age, as it’s spirit fades over time (roughly 75 - 100 years).  When a Familiar’s spirit fades, they are gone forever and the [[Wizard|Wizardry]] can not summon another Familiar ever again.

You can't have more than one Familiar at a time.  If you cast the Find Familiar spell while you already have a Familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form of your choosing.

!A Symbiotic Relationship
Your Familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands.  In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn.  A Familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

A Familiar and its master share in a symbolic relationship and are connected empathetically.  The Familiar’s personality and behavior mimic who they are linked to.  The rhythms and needs of the two entities become synchronized: when the master is hungry, so is the Familiar;  when the Familiar feels pain, so does the master.  This relationship grants a series of reciprocal powers that each may benefit from.

!Eidolon Abilities
As a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] levels up, the supernatural bond between them and their Familiar grows.  These advancements manifest at 1st, 3rd, 5th,11th, and 17th level.  Any abilities you receive instantly re removed when your Familiar dies.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Fazar/fazar.jpg]]

Fazar was born with the gift of [[Sorcery]].  It is said that he was of noble birth in the region now known as [[The Keep]].  He practiced with sword and lance as often as he did [[Magic]], making him widely known as the Wizard Knight.  He perfected the ruthless combination of sorcery and mastery of arms.

At the age of 22 he commanded an army into [[Orcish Lands]], using his [[Magic]] to turn the very land asunder.  He was legendary for entering battles with no armor, growing to gigantic proportions, and turning his skin as hard as stone.  He was known as &quot;Nigund&quot; in the [[Black Speech]], meaning &quot;stone one&quot; - and was much feared.

For years he pushed back the [[Orc]], who were amassing for war.  He returned home to a heroes welcome, until he received word from [[Armondax]] and [[Mysara]] that an even darker threat had been rising on Fazar's home soil.  [[The Demon Plague]] was in full effect, and [[The Holy Scourge]] had the world in its evil clutches.  Weary from war, Fazar commanded his [[Mage Guard]] to march - 1,000 of his soldiers who were equally proficient in sword and sorcery.  [[Cyril Viridian]], raised another 5,000 warriors.  It was these two armies that are thought to have been the rising tide of victory against [[The Holy Scourge]].

After they were victorious, [[Mysara]], [[Armondax]], Fazar and [[Waywill]] founded what is now known as [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]] in response to the [[Azutan Nagyos]], a war against magic by [[Cyril Viridian]] himself - who had overthrown the government and installed himself as [[Emperor]].  A new battle raged on - between practitioners of [[Magic]] and [[Cyril Viridian]].  A disgust for [[Magic]] had permeated the land, due to the events of [[The Demon Plague]] and [[The Destruction Of Uskard]], which saw a surge of [[Uskardeen]] refugees come to [[Kellos]].  After a few years of fighting, the [[Azutan Nagyos]] ended - and magic was no longer outlawed.

In the peaceful years that followed, Fazar fades from the historic record - it is assumed he died at a young age.</pre>

<pre>''__Spell: Fellowship (Cantrip) __''

Fellowship is a general spell that does not belong to any specific college.  This spell is unique in that it is taught only by [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]] to allow member to identify themselves.  The subject becomes aware that the caster is indeed a true member of the brotherhood and entitled to all the benefits thereof.  If cast on a subject not of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]], the subject will have no knowledge of the spell being cast. (Note:  The Fellowship spell is one’s first impression on other members of the order.  Make it good!  It is a social blunder to fail this spell or draw unnecessary attention to what you are doing by critically failing.  This is a form of secret handshake, and it is unseemly to have to use verbal or semantic components to cast.)</pre>

Fenwick Vendergeinst is a [[Half-Elf]] [[Wizard|Wizardry]] that specializes in the art of [[Transfiguration]] and [[Alchemy]].  As a young boy, he was a student in [[The Athenaeum]] with his good friend [[Barnabus Diggle]].  They remain good friends, and keep in constant contact through magical means.  Today he is over 170 years old, hard of hearing and struggles with the more advanced spells.

His [[Wizard|Wizardry]] [[Familiar]] was a female cat named [[Gillian]], who faded away back to [[The Feywild]] over 70 years ago.  He missed her very much, and has experimented multiple times in order to get her back.  Once instance he inadvertently split his own self into multiple animals, needing to be rescued by students of his good friend [[Barnabus Diggle]].

Fenwick's home is a tower in [[The Garden District]] of [[Zylok]] which he enchanted to appear shorter at larger distances.  Only when you are right upon it, does the full four stories of the circular tower come into full view.  Fenwick can't remember how he made this happen - but is sure he documented it somewhere in his vast collection of personal notes and journals.  His spellbook is extremely large and full of half thought through spells, experiments and interesting ideas - and it spans a collection of books that he keeps in his laboratory.

He was renown as an [[Alchemist|Alchemy]] but he retired many years ago, and only practices magic for his own enjoyment.

Fenwick's tower is locked by a front door enchanted with an arcane lock, however Fenwick continues to forget the password and often uses the [[Knock]] spell to enter.  Unfortunately, his security system is a magical set of armor which attacks anyone who enters without the password - even Fenwick himself.  Therefore, Fenwick doesn't leave his house very often because replacing the armor is costly.

Fenwick enjoys wearing outdated fashions which include a tall pointy hat and colorful exotic robes with moons and stars embroidered on them.</pre>

!Introduction
The Flagon is an inn/tavern located in the heart of downtown [[Laranor]].  It is often recognized as one of the best inn’s in the city.  [[Finnigan Flak]] runs the Flagon, a former [[Darkling Cloak]] who has given up his underworld existence.  The employees are very attentive to their customers, and [[Finnigan Flak]] keeps a close eye on all of his patrons.  Having a large [[Troll]] on the premises ([[Grub]]) does wonders for keeping customers in line.

!Ground Floor
The ground floor has a large room with tables and chairs to seat patrons who wish a meal, and a large bar that can seat the clientele interested in savoring [[Finnigan Flak]]’s choice liquors.  [[Grub]] ([[Flak’s|Finnigan Flak]] [[Troll]] bodyguard) often takes a seat at the end of the bar, and is generally found alone (simply because everyone is afraid to sit near him).

The ground floor also has a small common room where beds and lockers are available for those wishing to stay overnight cheaply.  Cost is 6 copper a night.  A public hot bath is available to those in the common room.
The kitchen is also located on the ground floor.  All perishables are stored in the basement, but two large stoves are located here.

!Basement
The basement is accessed by a spiral staircase in the back of the kitchen.  The main room in the basement houses table and chairs for the employees to lounge and eat.  Also some storage that overflowed from the two storage rooms.  [[Finnigan Flak]] also keeps his wood here for the stoves in the kitchen.  There are two rooms for storage: one houses all of the liquor, the other crates of food stuffs.  [[Finnigan Flak]] highly prizes his liquor stores.  [[Finnigan Flak]]’s personal bedroom is also found in the basement.  There are a few books on a nightstand, and a large leather reading chair.  Nothing of immediate value is found here.  He always keeps a knife under his pillow.

[[Finnigan Flak]]’s office is located near his bedroom.  It is always kept locked (with a complex lock, -3 to skill).  The office has a nice wooden desk, and leather office chair.  Also murals decorate the north wall, and bookcases decorate the south wall.  Two suits of armor guard the doorway.

There is a secret room that is accessed through the office, by means of the bookcases.  This secret room houses all of [[Finnigan Flak]]’s valuables.  Gold, jewels, weapons, and a few more suits of armou.  There is also a bed and enough food for someone to be hid away for nearly 2 weeks.

!Second Floor
The second floor contains all of the rooms for rent.  There is another common room like the one found on the ground floor, which costs 5 copper a night.

A single room (containing a bed and a cupboard) can be rented for 10 copper a night.  The patron is issued a key for their room. There are 9 single rooms.  A double room (containing two beds, and two footlockers) can be rented for 15 copper a night.  The patron is issued a key for their room.  There are 6 double rooms.</pre>

The Fomorians are hideous and wicked giants native to [[The Feywild]].  Their bodies appear to be almost randomly distributed; with warty and misshapen heads.  Many have limbs of varying sizes.

Most Fomorians live upon a floating island in [[The Feywild]] known as [[BaraDore]] (or &quot;Black Fog&quot; in [[Elvish]]), and are filled with greed and selfish desires.  The richest and most noble of the Fomorians collect memories and use their power to temporarily change their appearance to be pleasing.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/forana-lolo-kashira.jpg]]
The Forana’loloKashira are tall, slender humanoids (determine height normally and add 3”, weight is 10 pounds less than normal).  They grow hair only on their heads, usually gold or silver and kept long.  Their features are striking but delicate, with pointed ears and almond shaped eyes.  They wear beautiful clothing often adorned with silk and flowers, and are often referred to as Wood Elves.

!Slender And Graceful
With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beutiful to [[Humans|Human]] and members of many other [[Races]].

!Self Isolation Within Hidden Realms
The Forana’loloKashira are an ancient race dating back to [[The Third Age]].  They descend from the [[Third Age Elves]] of [[The Sylvan Empire]] who heeded the warnings of [[Raime Wesewierë]] and fled the cities before [[The Third Desecration]].  For centuries now they have lived quietly in the forests of [[Asha]], keeping away from the affairs of [[man|Human]].  The Forana’loloKashira have no real form of government, in [[Human]] terms.  Their [[Havens]] are overseen by a Council of Elders, as well as a group known as [[Holnobalga|The Emerald Order]] or &quot;[[The Emerald Order]]&quot;.  [[The Emerald Order]] is tasked with censoring [[Magic]] and science to prevent the Elves from causing another [[Desecration]]. It is a mystery to all but the Wood Elves how their [[Havens]] don’t simply give in to anarchy.

!Inner Peace
Although [[The Sylvan Empire]] is dead and the [[Havens]] of the Forana’loloKashira are independent of one another, there is a bond between all of the Wood Elves.  Their firm belief in the [[Larabira]] and [[BahaUlla Prophecy]] written in [[The Third Age]] grants them a serenity and inner peace unequaled within any other of the [[Races]].  Their immortality also affords them a more intimate knowledge of [[The Eternal Cycle]] and they believe that a great peace will one-day be sustained, their [[Havens]] will grow to cover [[Asha]], and rather than end with a desecration, [[The Eternal Cycle]] will be broken and eternal peace and prosperity will be had by all once again.  This new age will bring about peace in such a way that [[The Gods]] have not yet seen: the lion will sleep with the lamb, and the creatures of the earth will cease to eat of the flesh of one another.  All living beings will live in harmony with themselves, and death will be a memory.

!Dabblers and Artists
The Wood Elves live pleasantly among the animals in the forest.  The highest responsibility of life is to protect the woodlands in which they live.  Everything, even their own well being and that of the [[Variona'Sha]], is second to that.  Most of their days are spent tending to their tree homes and gardens.  Many practice [[Magic]] and some even a bit of swordplay or archery.  But all enjoy the festivities of the night.  Every night the Forana’loloKashira have feasts of dancing, drinking and song (a great number of Forana’loloKashira have alcoholism and related disadvantages).  Most of what they require is produced within the forest.  They grow food in their gardens, make weapons of wood, and are especially skilled makers of wines and ales.

!The Variona'Sha
The Forana’loloKashira culture is tangled with that of the [[Variona'Sha]], or Bronze Elves, who protect Forana'loloKashira [[Havens]] from harmful intrusion. The wood elves never meddle in affairs outside of their [[Havens]], however owe a great debt to the [[Variona'Sha]] and would come to their aid when it is needed (although the [[Variona'Sha]] have never asked for help).

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/gnome.jpg]]
|![[Click Here For Information on the Gafflinite Language|Gafflinite]]|
The Gafflinz (or gnomes) are a short and slight race.  They stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, similar to [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] but tend to be less well built.  They stand 2 feet shorter than a [[Human]] of equivalent strength and have 6 fingers on each hand (Gafflinz have a second thumb located on the opposite side of their palm).  They are normally bald, but may have tufts of hair on the top of their heads.  They grow thin beards the colors commonly found among [[humanity|Human]].  Their skin is pale and their facial features are broad and flat.  Their eyes vary in colors considered unnatural by many races (purple, gold, pink, bright red, white and silver). 

!From Another World
The ancestors of the Gafflinz were transported to [[Asha]] during [[The Cataclysm]] of [[The Second Age]], ripped from their home.  In a failed attempt to return to whence they came, they created [[The Ways]] - where they currently reside.  It is very rare for a Gafflinz to be found outside of the protection this dimensional space gives.  The Gafflinz dedication to social and cultural isolation has worked perfectly for millennia.  Their inventions, research, knowledge, skills, and even their language is unknown to the other races of Asha.

!Secrets Made, Secrets Kept
Gafflinz are gatherers of information, inventors, and scholars.  Gafflinz horde knowledge, and never share their [[creations|GafflinzInventions]] or wisdom with other [[races|Races]].  They are suspicious of all other [[races|Races]], but curious at the same time.  With their fondness and thirst for information, it is not uncommon for a Gafflinz to be extremely chatty on subjects that would be considered boring to those not of the same mentality.  Gafflinz culture is very secretive.  They keep their customs, lives, cities, and people hidden from all outsiders.  The Gafflinz written language is actually written using a complex cipher, requiring Cryptoanalysis skills to read.  Their cities and written language have been out of reach (even through magic means) due to the sheer diligence of the Gafflinz to remain isolated.

!Technologically Advanced
The Gafflinz have access to levels of technology unheard of on [[Asha]].  They understand the concept of gears, clockworks, and steam power.  This level of engineering is something they would never consider sharing with the &quot;lesser&quot; [[Races]] (meaning anyone who isn't a Gafflinz).

!Roughing It
It should be noted that while Gafflinz may be encountered (albeit rarely) outside of their forbidden cities, they are actively engaged in research and observation.  A Gafflinz may be on a stakeout, eyeing the comings and goings and daily events of a [[Human]] city.  Sometimes the observers remain hidden behind a makeshift camouflage net or barrier, in the same way a [[Human]] might observe an animal in its natural habitat.   Never would an average Gnomish citizen venture out of their city, only a handful of researchers may attend expeditions outside of the city walls - doing so would be considered &quot;Roughing It&quot;.

!Magical Resistance
Gafflinz have a very strong [[Magical Resistance]], which renders them nearly immune to all but the strongest magic.  The source of this resistance is unknown even to the Gafflinz, but they still devote massive amounts of effort into the study of possible causes.  In the meantime, their magical resistance hampers others from using malicious means of extracting secrets from these isolationist’s brains.

!Bureaucracy
The Gafflinz elect officials to oversee their cities, which they call [[Professors|Gafflinz Professors]].  The [[Professors|Gafflinz Professors]] and their appointed [[Council|Gafflinz Council]] serve for a period of ten years.  The [[Professors|Gafflinz Professors]] and council approve and fund all research and development that is performed by the citizens of the city.  It is well within their right to cease funding on a particular project, and concentrate the city's efforts in a more promising direction.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Notable People/The Keep/Deepwater/galad-jedaleon.jpg]]

Galad Jedaleon (1006 [[AAP]] - current) is the [[Emperor]] of [[The Viridian Empire]]. Ruler of the [[Kell]], the [[Amoni]], and the [[Uskardeen]]. He is [[Marshall]] of [[The Keep]], [[Shield]] of [[Deepwater]] and head of [[House Jedaleon]]. He is a tall and handsome young man, everything a budding [[Emperor]] should be. He strives hard to achieve, due to the incompetence of his younger brother (whom Galad Jedaleon loves dearly). He is working very hard to continue his father’s dream of prosperity across [[Kellos]] by abolishing Slavery, and his personal goal is to unite the [[Races]] of [[Kellos]]: [[Dwarf]], [[Elf]], [[Bairn]], [[Human]], and [[Orc]] in a council of peace.

He excels at everything he sets out to accomplish.  Trained by [[Garet Napier]] in swordplay, he can best many of [[The Knights Of Deepwater]] in one on one combat.  [[Rolo Cavat]] taught him battlefield tactics, and how to command armies and naval ships; and [[Rolo|Rolo Cavat]] to this day talks about how quickly he picked it up.  Despite his tremendous skill, Galad secretly does not wish to be [[Emperor]], but continues because his brother is not of the quality to assume the throne.  He instead just wishes to be left alone rather than have the weight of [[Kellos]] on his shoulders.

His mother [[Katarin Karbold]] died in 1017 [[AAP]] when Galad was 11 years old.  His fondest memory of her is when she would play her harp as a lullaby to him and his brother [[Greco Jedaleon]].  After her death, Galad learned to play that song in her honor, and plays it for his baby sister [[Natalia Jedaleon]].  He plays beautiful, but refuses to learn another song on the harp other than this one.  Galad is drawn to his mother's garden inside of the castle, where he spends quiet solitude near a statue of her.  He is fiercely protective of the garden, and insists that he alone cares for it.  She was known for her green thumb as well as her generosity, and would freely distribute the exotic fruits to those most in need.  Galad continues this tradition in her loving memory.

Galad inherited the throne at a time of great sorrow and peril.  His father was murdered during an attack on the city of [[Deepwater]] by an ancient cult known as [[The Remnant]], where many perished.  He harbors a great hatred for [[The Remnant]], for [[Blood Magic]], and for atrocities against [[The Gods]].

Gargauth was the warlord of [[Avernus]], the first circle of [[Baator]] known as [[The Circle Of Pride|Avernus]] until he was supplanted by [[Shalekasha]].  He is a [[Dathairä]] skilled in betrayal and political corruption.  He resembles a crimson-scaled colossus with massive, bat-like wings, clawed extremities, and fangs that drip a green, smoking venom.

Calculating and calm, Gargauth is charming.  He is one of the greatest military minds in [[Baator]], using tactical advantage and only engaging in combat on his own terms.  His favored tactic involves ambushes, double-crosses, feints and counter-feints; backstabbing his enemies while anticipating the treacherous moves of his rivals.  While he is generally cool-headed, he can erupt into anger; especially when the topic of [[Shalekasha]] is broached.

He is prideful, greedy, and cruel.  Gargauth is a dangerous and thoroughly wicked being, the guise of civil compasion he wears at first only making the cruelty more horrible.  He comes off personable and charming, which is just a veneer for a being so utterly foul.  He has more self-control than most of his kind, and believes himself to be one of, if not the, smartest [[Dathairä]].

<pre>History and information about the realms can only be found in the small and pitiful archives kept by the [[Humans|Human]].  Unfortunately the libraries of the [[Humans|Human]] are very sparse concerning the creation and past of Asha, due to their race being so young.

!Regions Of Kellos
The largest civilization on [[Asha]], [[The Viridian Empire]] is on the continent of [[Kellos]].  It is comprised of 9 regions: [[The Northlands]], [[The Green Sea]], [[The Stone Lands]], [[The Isles]], [[The Keep]], [[The Coast]], [[The Waste]], [[Orcish Lands]], and [[The Elvish Lands]].  It is here, where the game will take place, and much of the adventure on [[Asha]] will be had.

Human maps are vague and often inaccurate concerning anything outside their major zone of control (which is an approximate 600 mile wide, 400 mile high landmass).  Modern day explorers find passage East past [[The Nenakessana River]] to be difficult.  These untamed lands are the battleground for the holy war between the [[Elves|Elf]] and the [[Orc]].  Even the most way of travelers often find themselves caught between the two warring factions.

Passage North is easier, how ever travel is slowed by thick lush forests with trees that appear to be as old as the land itself.   These mystical forests are rumored to be the resting place of [[The Sylvan Empire]], although explorers have never found any signs or clues (other than an eerie sense of being watched, which pierces the heart of even the strongest of will).

Passage South takes the traveler through [[Orcish lands]].  Colonization of these territories is a laughable undertaking at best, due to the hostility of the environment.  Large active volcanoes, stagnant marshes, and dense tropical jungles indicate how this wild land is still primordial in nature.

!Doppelganger
|//''Required Components:'' A cherished personal possession, A portion of the target: lock of hair, piece of flesh, vial of blood. Multiple fresh corpses.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 6 weeks|
|''Range:'' Touch|
|''Duration:'' Permanent|
A Doppelganger is a duplicate of a person, fabricated through powerful magic.  The doppelganger must be prepared for a specific target; both a sample of the target's body (hair, blood, etc) and a cherished personal possession of the target are required.
The caster spends 6 weeks constructing a duplicate made from shaping flesh and bone of fresh corpses.  The cherished item is placed inside of the construction - allowing the doppelganger to retain any memory of events that occurred while the target was nearby the item.  The caster rolls a d20 at advantage, the rolled number being the DC for others to detect the deception of the duplicate.  The DM can rule a modifier to the roll of up to -10/+10 depending on the connection the target has to the possession.  The doppelganger acts as the original would have, enslaved by the caster.  Spells that affect curses have the ability to paralyze or destroy the doppelganger.  If the doppelganger is destroyed, the flesh quickly rots into a puddle and the personal possession is left intact.
It can be very difficult to detect the trickery.

!Flesh Armor
|//''Required Components:'' The entire fleshly harvested skin of another creature of the caster's size.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 minute|
|''Range:'' Personal|
|''Duration:'' 10 minutes/level or until discharged|
During the casting of this spell, the caster harvests the skin of another creature of similar size to the caster.  The caster takes the flayed skin and lays it upon their own flesh, wearing it like clothing or armor.  Once the caster casts flesh armor, their skin develops resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes.  Once the spell has prevented a total of 5 points of damage per caster level (maximum 50 points), it is discharged and the skin slowly rots away, shedding in patches like the skin of a molting snake.
The ritual requires a bit of flesh from the caster's body, causing 1d6 damage.

!Homunculus
|//''Required Components:'' An unborn baby and a chunk of the caster's flesh.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 hour|
|''Range:'' Personal|
|''Duration:'' Permanent|
This ritual links the caster's spirit to a fetus that must be kept inside a glass bottle and fed at least 1 hit point worth of human blood each day to remain alive.  The homunculus has a Strength and Constitution of 1, and no Dexterity, Intelligence, Charisma, or Wisdom.  It has a single hit point.  If the bottle is broken or submitted to intense heat or light, the homunculus dies.
Whenever they wish, as an action, the caster can move their spirit into the homunculus, no matter how far away it is.  When their senses are within the homunculus, they can see through their eyes and hear what it hears - during this time they are deaf and blind in regards to their own senses.  The caster has the ability to observe and communicate with anyone in the homunculus's presence.  Although the caster can cast spells from the humunculus, they can not perform any physical action as they are trapped within the bottle.  As an action the caster can return to their own body.
If a hostile mage gains possession of a live homunculus, they can cast spells on its owner with no range penalty!  The creator also is at disadvantage to resist any spells cast through the homunculus.  A homunculus is thus a great vulnerability and is only entrusted to the most faithful of servants.
The caster may own several humunculi; they can move their spirit to only one at a time.
Creating a homunculus causes 1d10 of damage as the caster carves a piece of their own flesh to store within the bottle.

!Imprison Soul
|//''Required Components:'' A portion of the target's body (a fingernail, a lock of hair, or some other small part) and a prepared receptacle.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1d4 days / 1 action|
|''Range:'' 100 ft + 10 ft / level|
The creation of the receptacle takes 1d4 days.  After the target dies within 60ft of the receptacle, they make a Wisdom saving throw at a DC of 15.  On a success, the caster takes 2d6 psychic damage.  On a failure, the subject's soul enters a receptacle such as a gem, ring or some other minuscule object, leaving the subject's body lifeless.  While trapped, the subject takes 1d4 points of damage per day, until dead or freed.  They can cast spells that do not require verbal, somatic or material components from within their prison.  The rituals to prepare the receptacle require three days.  Destroying or opening the receptacle ends the spell, releasing the soul.
To cast the spell, the receptacle and target must be within spell range and the caster must know where it is.  The caster must also know the name of the target.

!Kandar's Guidestar
|//''Required Components:'' A living creature from the water or sea, A portion of the target's body (a fingernail, a lock of hair, or some other small part) and an object of importance to the subject.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 hour|
|''Range:'' touch|
Through this foul enchantment, the caster summons the power of [[Kandar]] in order to hold sway over a victim.  The caster must fashion a doll (usually out of wax, clay, or straw) with an object of importance and personally relevant to the target embedded within.  Parts of the target's body (nail clippings, hair, blood, saliva) are required to bind the identity of the target to the doll.
As a bonus action, the doll can be used to know the general direction of the subject.
A living creature from the water or sea is required to be sacrificed in order for the ritual to be complete.  For every living creature of this type sacrificed, the object can be used that many times to cast spells on the doll that target the subject with no range penalty.

|//''Required Components:'' Holy Symbol.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 day|
|''Range:'' Touch|
This ritual corrupts a Holy Symbol by soaking it with urine and imbuing it with demonic energy.  At the conclusion of the ritual, the Holy Symbol is a magical object that when desired can be activated by crumbling it into a powder.  When used, the powder can be sprinkled on the ground creating an invisible 20ft x level long trail that attracts [[Fiends|Fiend]], [[Devil|Devils]], and [[Undead]].  Any of these creatures that come within 10ft of the trail must make a Wisdom save of DC 14 or be compelled to follow the trail to the end as if affected by a compulsion effect.
Compelled creatures will follow a nether trail even into danger.  For example, the trail could lead to a trap, a holy spell effect, or even a prison cell.  If the danger is obvious, such as a blade barrier, the compelled creatures get another saving throw to resist.
A compelled creature only follows the trail to its end.  So if the trail leads to the edge of a cliff, the creatures goes to the edge of the cliff and no farther.
If a creature encounters the trail in the middle, it instinctively senses which direction is forward and which is backward.  When the creature reaches the end of the trail, the compulsion effect ends, and the creature cannot be affected by this particular nether trail again.
The trail can be obscured and destroyed by anyone who can see invisible objects.  It takes a standard action to destroy 10 feet of trail but a creature must make its saving throw first.

!Pact Of The Undying
|//''Required Components:'' The caster's own heart, and the body and soul of a blood relative.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 hour|
|''Range:'' Personal|
|''Duration:'' Permanent|
This ritual effectively renders an individual immortal by removing the connection between their soul and their body.  After a successful ritual, their soul and essence is transferred into their heart - which is promptly removed from their body.  The heart will continue to grow flesh, bone and skin until it is an exact duplicate of the caster.  This process takes 2d6 years to complete.  While the original body may still be hurt (burned, cut, crushed...), death results in the caster returning to this new body.  If death occurs before the body is complete, the caster is trapped inside of it until it is complete.  Depending on the state of completion, the caster may not be able to move or see.  The heart begins with a Strength and Constitution of 1, and no Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity or Charisma.  The heart has a single hitpoint.
If his heart is destroyed, the caster dies.  This is why it is usually hidden in a very hard to reach place.  Death may also come from some magical causes, such as a Planar Visit failure.  There is only one chance the caster has to perform this ritual - if the ritual fails, the caster dies.
This pact ritual is made with the [[Dathairä]] named [[Urdlen]], who required the body and soul of a blood relative, which is consumed during the ritual.
The caster takes 1d10 necrotic damage during the ritual.
@@Urdlen, great one.  Guardian of the gate, master of fear and death, Hear me and answer my urgent plee!  Take my sacrifice of blood and provide me with everlasting life!
Urdlen, mad ni.  Rogtarat ob doraz, goth ob under agh vadak, daggog ishi agh ault ishi mauraun lup.  Katrann ishi fli ob gijak agh laudh ishi dolpan gajal!@@

!Refuge
|//''Required Components:'' A vial of liquid pain.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 10 minutes|
|''Range:'' personal|
|''Duration:'' Permanent|
Cast on any one item which is soaked in a vial of liquid pain.  That item is now imbued with power such that when it is broken the one holding it and everything they carry is transported back to the location the ritual was performed.  This occurs instantly, regardless of the distance.

!Soul Bind
|//''Required Components:'' A willing creature, liquid pain and a prepared receptacle.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 24 hours|
|''Range:'' touch|
Let's the caster place a soul into some object (which must be present).  If the subject is not the caster, they must be willing.  Liquid pain is used to coax the soul from the body.
If your soul is bound into an object, you are unaffected until either your body dies, or the object is destroyed.  The death of your body will not kill you.  Your consciousness shifts to the object, where you are able to see, hear, and even cast any spell that does not require verbal, somatic, or material components.  If anyone is touching the object, you may communicate by direct mental contact.  Your attributes (for saving throw purposes) remain the same as when you had a body.
If a new body comes within range of your object, you may try to take it through Possession (if you are skilled in that ritual).  In that case, the soul of the body you inhabit goes into the object you now occupy.  When an object that has a bound soul within it is destroyed, the soul is destroyed permanently beyond hope of resurrection, even if the body is alive and unharmed.

!Soul Golem
|//''Required Components:'' The caster's soul and a [[Golem]].//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 day|
|''Range:'' personal|
|''Duration:'' Permanent|
The caster transfers their soul into a [[Golem]] of their own making.  They gain the [[Golem's|Golem]] physical attributes, but retain their knowledge, mental attributes, and casting ability.  The original body dies in the ritual, and there is no going back!  At the completion of the ritual, the caster makes a single Constitution saving throw of DC 12 - a failure means the ritual was unsuccessful and the caster dies!  This savings throw can be reduced by 1 for every vial of Liquid Pain used during the ritual.  A DC of 0 is an automatic success.

!Spider Hand
|//''Required Components:'' One dead spider the size of the caster's hand and 1 soul.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 30 minutes|
|''Range:'' Personal|
|''Duration:'' Permanent|
The caster performs a ritual that permanently severs their hand from their body - imbuing it with the power of a spider.  The hand is permanently blackened, but can be detached as an action and controlled.  It functions as a spider, traveling up to 20 ft per level away from the owner - who can also chose to see through its eyes.  If the hand is killed or prevented from returning to the owner - the hand is lost.</pre>

Gretchen Jamarion is the wife of [[Santino Jamarion]]. While he runs the house for [[The Grey Companions]], she runs the kitchens. She is an excellent cook, and is famous for her stew.

She has a perfect memory, and can remember anything she concentrates on (which is mostly cooking).  She is constantly nagging [[Santino Jamarion]], as she can always remember everything he has done wrong.  He has learned to just accept it and move on.

Gretchen possesses a bravery that borders on foolhardy.  She speaks her mind, and is not afraid of confrontation.  Gretchen has a peculiar way of working food analogies into normal conversation.  She has been known to describe people as onions, broth, or dumplings.  Many years ago, [[Santino Jamarion]] was aghast when Gretchen referred to a visiting noble as &quot;Lord Noodle&quot;, because he was so spineless and slippery (and she just didn't like the look of him).

It takes awhile for Gretchen to warm up to new people, and she has a general suspicion when she first meets them.  Her husband is wise to this, and ensures she stays in the kitchen when visitors arrive.  However she sneaks sideways glances at them to ensure they aren't up to no good.  She doesn't dislike new people, only wants to ensure they don't cause any mischief.  Once she gets to know them, Gretchen is a loyal friend and companion - and treats her closest compatriots like family.

It is difficult to find someone who takes more pride in being a member of [[The Viridian Empire]] than Gretchen.  She is fanatic in her support for the [[Emperor]], and claims her family tree intersects with [[House Jedaleon]] in a very distant bloodline, even though there is no evidence.  [[Santino Jamarion]] hates this story, and dismisses it as blabber.</pre>

!Description
The isle of Grimstone within [[The Risen Reef]] off of the coast of [[Amon]] is home to [[The Mummers]], a pirate organization led by [[The Salt King]].  Over two centuries ago in 785 [[AAP]], Grimstone was claimed by [[The Mummers]] as a safe haven due to the shallow reefs that make getting there perilous.
[[The Mummers]] are a loose union of pirates and criminals who amass their wealth through cunning, intimidation, and cleverness.  [[The Salt King]] keeps the order on the island, which is surprisingly crime free.  It is kept this way through harsh punishments dealt to those who cause trouble and don't abide by the few laws found there.
Of all of the islands within [[The Jade Sea]], none is the equal of Grimstone.  Dangerous, boisterous, drunken and bawdy, it is a pirate heaven.  Named after how the caves within the cliff face resemble a skull from the right angle.

It is a smaller, isolated city with dense forests and mountains making passage all but impossible except for the single road leading into the city.  in 1003 [[AAP]] during [[The Siege Of Derby]], [[House Blackbriar]] used the chaos to murder [[House Carrington]] and blame the deed on [[House Conlon]].  Being a [[Vampire]], [[Martin Blackbriar]] brought death and darkness to [[Hagen]] and the surrounding area.  The townsfolk were all but imprisoned as [[Blackbriar's|Martin Blackbriar]] power grew and a magical fog surrounded them and acted as a barrier they could not break through.  [[Martin Blackbriar]] is no more, but the evil he committed here still lingers.  The 18 years in which he grew in power sapped life and hope from the people of Hagen.  Though homes have been rebuilt and undead monstrosities have been eradicated, the trauma of his reign will be carrier by the people for generations.  It was [[The Grey Companions]] who liberated the town in 1021 [[AAP]].

Limited in fertile farm land, locally grown produce is scarce - keeping the size of the town small.  Castle Hagen is an ancient structure erected not long after the town's founding - and has been the noble seat of [[House Carrington]] until their fall.  The interior has a regal starkness to it, while the hunting trophies and tapestries that decorate the walls are clear signs of wealth, there is a solumn, beautiful hollowness to its corridors.  [[Frederick Carrington]], who now holds control of the city claims the walls carry the melancholy of [[House Carrington]], and the sorrow for witnessing the [[Blackbriar's|House Blackbriar]] evil.

Veins of [[Cavorite]] are found in the area, which when distilled with acids form into a material known as [[Residuum]] that is susceptible to [[Enchantment]].

Harmost Xawn was one of the most powerful and fiercest warlords of [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]] during [[The Third Age]].  He was a powerful warrior and a cunning tactician that earned him the respect of even his rivals.  As [[Ammenon's|Ammenon]] armies swept across the land crushing the territories of the other warlords, Xawn was able to hold his nation's ground through successive brilliant tactical maneuvers and battle prowess.

Xawn's army was a match for [[Ammenon's|Ammenon]], and for years Xawn harried the growing undead army that [[Ammenon]] commanded.  Xawn no longer held his ground, but began to win battle after battle against armies that dwarfed his in size.  The loses grated on [[Ammenon]], who wished to see the continent fully subjugated until his rule.

In the end, [[Ammenon]] himself took to the field personally to see too Harmost Xawn's defeat.  In an epic battle, Xawn was bested but in a rare act of mercy ordered by [[Ammenon]] to be spared.  He forced Xawn to watch as his army, tired and beaten were slaughtered like animals and the heads of his soldiers arrayed in a pile before him; including his two sons who acted as his field lieutenants.  His will broken, [[Ammenon]] used [[Blood Magic]] to corrupt Xawn's mind into a faithful bodyguard, servant and slave to his will.  Xawn became a shell of his former self; no longer fully of this world.</pre>

<pre>The Haven Bag is a [[Magical|Magic]] artifact created by [[Erik Doorhaus]] through the use of [[Enchantment]] in 1020 [[AAP]].

The contents are actually inside of a pocket dimension that is floating in [[The Astral Stream]].  This was the first [[Enchanted|Enchantment]] artifact that [[Erik Doorhaus]] made.

They have a thick armored skull (PD 3, DR 4) and thick scaly skin that is PD 2 DR 2.

[[Dwarves|Dwarf]] keep Halmkopek's as pets - as they keep the vermin population in the city low.  The lizards are fiercely loyal to their owners, like a dog, and can be trained to respond to simple commands.

!Concerning The History Of Asha
From the dawn of the universe to the current [[Age|The Fourth Age]], the history of [[Asha]] is rich and full of wonders.  Much of the history of the universe is lost to time or is a many jumbled misunderstanding of the myths passed down through oral traditions, or religious writings that favor a particular teaching and theology.  The details are often debated, and while most plod forward living their entire lives without little care as to how [[Asha]] was created, there exist those who are hungry for purpose and willing to explore the dangerous unknowns where secrets may yet still lie.

!The Beginning
In a time before time, primordial forces known today as [[The Old Gods]] began to take shape into a universe that was new and formless.  They cared only for their own existence; consuming, expanding, and thriving.  One of these entities, known as [[Umwe]], created [[his children|The Gods]] which would later become [[The Gods]] of [[Asha]].  After a great struggle with [[Azarad-Ji]], [[Asha]] was created as a final resting place for [[Valouria]], and [[The Gods]] imprisoned [[Azarad-Ji]] where he could do no harm.  In doing so, they created [[The Eternal Cycle]] which acted as an impenetrable veil that sealed [[Asha]] away from from the direct influences of [[The Old Gods]].  Sadly, this carried with it a self-imposed sentence of exile - they would henceforth never be allowed to directly visit [[Valouria]].  [[Asha]] would forever be the realm for mortals. 

!The Origins Of Life
[[Asha]] was soon verdant and flowing with life, sprung from what final spark was left inside of [[Valouria]].  [[The Gods]] watched with wonder at the marvels of beauty found on the surface.  Over the eons, life continued to form and change; and it was to their surprise when they witnessed the first [[Humans|Human]] to take their first steps upon the surface of [[Asha]].  These creatures were capable of creating magnificent works and began to seize their place on the planet.

!Ages
In [[The Eternal Cycle]], Ages come and go.  Life struggles to retain its delicate foothold, only to then blossom into a precious understanding of itself.  Like a moth to a flame, life longs to understand its creator; only to undo themselves with the knowledge they seek.  Again and again, [[The Eternal Cycle]] repeats, and new Ages are born - each with Life rending itself with its own hubris.  Memories of past Ages fade into story and dust, allowing this dark history to repeat as Life fails to learn its most important lesson.  Yet time is eternal, and in the Fourth Age, an Age yet to come and an Age long past, a new hope arises.  The hope was not the beginning, there are neither beginnings nor endings to [[The Eternal Cycle]].  But it was a beginning.  Sages separate the history of the universe into [[Ages]], each a fascinating period of history marked with an abrupt end known as a [[Desecration]].

| [img[images/history/the-age-of-gods-icon.jpg][The First Age]] &lt;br&gt;[[The Age Of Gods|The First Age]] |Known as [[The First Age]], ** timeline = //lost to history//&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[The First Age]] was a time of peace an prosperity, where the surface of [[Asha]] was lush and fertile.  [[Humanity|Human]] sprung from the final sparks of [[Valouria]] and proceeded to grow in knowledge and hubris.  They attempted to pierce the fabric of [[The Eternal Cycle]] and brought about [[The First Desecration]] in an attempt to lean about their origin.|
| [img[images/history/the-age-of-sorrow-icon.jpg][The Second Age]] &lt;br&gt;[[The Age Of Sorrow|The Second Age]] |[[The Second Age]] ** timeline = //lost to history//&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;War and strife plagued the majority of [[The Second Age]], as battles raged across all of [[The Planes Of Existence]].  Monstrosities belched forth from unknown regions, snuffing out life along with [[The Cataclysm]] which rendered [[Humanity|Human]] to dust. After [[The Gods]] were victories once again, they left their children [[The Dwarves|Dwarf]] and [[The Elves|Elf]] to care for their precious [[Asha]].  [[The Gods]] then self-exiled themselves, closing [[The Divine Gate]] to ensure [[Azarad-Ji]] would never be freed again.|
| [img[images/history/the-sylvan-age-icon.jpg][The Third Age]] &lt;br&gt;[[The Sylvan Age|The Third Age]] |[[The Third Age]] ** timeline = 8022 [[IO]] to 2127 [[IO]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This age saw an age of enlightenment for the [[Elves|Elf]] and the rise and fall of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  [[Humanity|Human]] gained a strong foothold in what is now the continent of [[Amon]], and the undying tyrant [[Ammenon]] slaughtered the [[Draugaira]] [[Elves|Elf]] in order to seek his own godhood. [[The Third Desecration]]|

Magic befell [[The Destruction Of Uskard]], while at the same time [[Kellos]] was battling [[The Demon Plague]]. [[The Amoni Empire]] crumbled under it's sheer size, [[Kellos]] forming what is known as [[The Old Republic]] and [[Amon]] the [[Polités]] that exist to this day.|</pre>

Hooper Berengar was the owner of [[Hooper's Dreamland]], a carnival and circus within [[The Sunset Isles]].  He was a con man and a swindler, skilled in slight of hand and [[Arcane Trickery|Magic]].  Despite it being a front for criminal activity, he took delight in the circus and enjoyed being the center of attention.  He had many animals on display that he loved, including a bear, a [[Wilk]], and an [[Griffon]].

His circus came to an end when a young [[Noble]] named [[Penelope Kensington]] skilled in [[Divination]] left his troupe.  She had drawn large crowds, and without her to headline the crowds became sparse.</pre>

Hooper's Dreamland was a circus in [[The Sunset Isles]] started by [[Hooper Berengar]], a con-man and swindler.  He used the circus as a cover to steal from noble and well-off audience members.  The troupe was made up of many that claimed powers and abilities that didn't exist; yet for a brief time [[Penelope Kensington]] joined the group and turned it upside down.  She had true power that was able to see the future, sense trouble, and predict local events - [[Hooper Berengar]] took notice of the crowds she drew.

The circus disbanded, when [[Penelope Kensington]] decided to leave.  This was due to a dispute with [[Hooper Berengar]] who wanted her to expand the routine to deceive common folk.  She left in disgust, and the circus crumbled without her as the headline.</pre>

The citizens of [[Deepwater]] are very fond of their [[Emperor]], for the great line of [[Jedaleon Emperors]] have been kind and good to their loyal subjects.  The Jedaleon’s are famous for loving their people, and imposing little taxes to the everyday citizen.

!Background
House Karbold is one of the [[Houses Of The Viridian Empire]].  They rule over [[The Northlands]] of [[Kellos]], their seat the city of [[Kohor]].  [[Kohor]] is an ancient city of [[The First Men]], whom the Karbolds are decended from.  The Karbolds still hold to many traditions of [[The First Men]], but have bent knee to [[The Viridian Empire]] so long ago that the few tribal [[Kells|Kell]] that remain, who have changed little since the days of [[The First Men]] are like savages to them.

Light of hair, and thick of muscle, Karbolds have always been fierce warriors and shrewd tacticians.  Their crest is a grey bear's paw on a black field.

<pre>The Human race dominates [[Asha]] with sheer numbers.  Known more commonly as the race of “Man” they currently comprise a leading majority of the planet’s population, and their civilization dominates much of the known world - hence the current Age being known as [[The Age Of Man|The Fourth Age]].

Mankind's spread has quickly grown, taking advantage of the empty spaces vacated by the once great [[Sylvan Empire|The Sylvan Empire]].  However, their civilization is still in its infancy.

While the other races of [[Asha]] such as the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] and [[Elves|Elf]] each possess an origin that ties them to [[The Gods]], Humans have no such connection.  Their origins are mysterious and unknown, thought to have sprung from the final spark of the dying [[Valouria]].

Currently, the realms of [[Asha]] are home to countless Kingdoms, Empires, social groups, or clans who all differ in culture and background.  These differences are enough to create language or cultural barriers which can make communication between the Human sub-species difficult.

|Type|plugin|
|Description|adds support for resizing images|
This plugin adds optional syntax to scale an image to a specified width and height and/or interactively resize the image with the mouse.
!!!!!Usage
&lt;&lt;&lt;
The extended image syntax is:
{{{
[img(w+,h+)[...][...]]
}}}
where ''(w,h)'' indicates the desired width and height (in CSS units, e.g., px, em, cm, in, or %). Use ''auto'' (or a blank value) for either dimension to scale that dimension proportionally (i.e., maintain the aspect ratio). You can also calculate a CSS value 'on-the-fly' by using a //javascript expression// enclosed between &quot;&quot;&quot;{{&quot;&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;&quot;}}&quot;&quot;&quot;. Appending a plus sign (+) to a dimension enables interactive resizing in that dimension (by dragging the mouse inside the image). Use ~SHIFT-click to show the full-sized (un-scaled) image. Use ~CTRL-click to restore the starting size (either scaled or full-sized).
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Examples
&lt;&lt;&lt;
{{{

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Kiraga/imameli.jpg]]

Imameli, roughly translated from [[Elvish]] as &quot;the harvester of love&quot; is a [[Kiraga]] sworn to [[Azarad-Ji]] that aided in [[The Third Desecration]].  She was once a young [[Elven|Elf]] maiden who fell in love with [[Raime Wesewierë]] due to his kind heart and gentle soul.  Being a prophet and holy man, he gently rejected her advances.  She took the news roughly.  Heartbroken, she found it impossible to get over her love for [[Raime Wesewierë]].

She sought a means to obtain the love that was beyond her reach, and [[Zezebazum]] appeared in his natural hideous form.  After overcoming her fear, [[Zezebazum]] explained how the two of them have similar goals.  The [[Dathairä]] explained how [[Raime Wesewierë]] was key to his plans, and was to be the ruler of [[Asha]] after the [[Desecration]].  [[Zezebazum]] needed [[Raime Wesewierë]], and Imameli would be the means by which he would get him.  If she were to sway [[Raime Wesewierë]], [[Zezebazum]] bargained that he would ensure the two of them would rule together.

Greedily agreeing to the bargain, she became the [[Kiraga]] known forevermore as Imameli.  Her transformation gave her horns, and wings - and charm and control spells to ensnare the opposite sex.  As history has recorded, she failed in her attempt to convert [[Raime Wesewierë]].</pre>

ImoMahtara (&quot;Illustrious Warrior&quot; in [[Elvish]]) was an ordinary [[AstraKashira]] foot soldier of [[The Radiant Guard]].  She fought for [[Lucian]] during [[The Second Age]], and became a hero for her sacrifice that ended [[The Second Age]] and saw to the imprisonment of [[Azarad-Ji]] during [[The Night Of Tears]].  She was brave and loyal, but had no deeds to her name.  In [[Lucian's|Lucian]] time of trouble, it was ImoMahtara who came to her aid.  She obtained [[Lucian's|Lucian]] fallen staff, [[The Spire Of Planes]] and struck down the [[Dathairä]] [[Drelmor]], shattering [[The Spire Of Planes]] and vaporizing both [[Drelmor]] and herself in the process.</pre>

<pre>__Disadvantage: Intolerance For Magic (-5 Points)__

Characters with an intolerance for [[Magic]] see all forms of [[Magic]] as unnatural and wrong.  Their resentment is most likely tied to the [[Azutan Nagyos]], the historical banning of magic from [[The Viridian Empire]] some 1,000 years ago.  While [[Magic]] is once again tolerated by the general population, there remain some who understand the razor's edge the world of [[Asha]] is balancing on between [[Magic]] and [[The Fourth Desecration]].</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Kiraga/iraki.jpg]]

Iraki, meaning &quot;Child Of Darkness&quot; in [[Elvish]] is a [[Kiraga]] sworn to [[Azarad-Ji]] that aided in [[The Third Desecration]].  Prior to falling to darkness and becoming a [[Kiraga]], he was known as Mathu'eire (translation &quot;sea friend&quot;).  He was a famous sailor and explorer with a taste for adventure.  He was the first [[Elf]] to circumnavigate the globe, and bring back detailed maps of [[Asha]].  He explored in order to find evidence of the civilization he believed existed in [[The First Age]], a time in which [[mankind|Human]] ruled over nature with technology and science.  Mathu'eire became renowned for finding trinkets of [[The First Age]], but his exploring kept him away from his wife and children for long periods of time - filling him with an intense longing.

His final adventure had him returning triumphantly home after finding a great number of artifacts from [[The First Age]].  To his horror, he found his city ransacked by [[Orcs|Orc]] and his wife, children and kinsman dead.  Unbeknownst to Mathu'eire, the [[Dathairä]] [[Zezebazum]] was behind the murder of the townsfolk - his plan to bring Mathu'eire to a moment of weakness and despair.  Devastated by the death and destruction, Mathu'eire was at his breaking point and very vulnerable.

[[Zezebazum]], disguised as a trusted sailing companion, explained how he had unlocked the secrets of one of the artifacts from [[The First Age]].  A metallic gauntlet with a short sharp spike protruding from the wrist, with the ability to resurrect the dead.  [[Zezebazum]] showed with feigned excitement at how he was able to bring back an animal from the dead by using the spike on the gauntlet at the base of the animal's skull.  Excited at the prospect of bringing back his family, Mathu'eire grabbed to gauntlet and rushed to the bodies of his loved ones.  [[Zezebazum]] warned that he was dabbling with powerful and unknown forces beyond his control, and advised Mathu'eire to stop.  Without hesitation, Mathu'eire used the artifact to bring his family and friends back, only to find them reanimate as corpses incapable of thought.

Mathu'eire fell quickly into a deeper spiral of darkness and madness, incapable of destroying those he loved - even if they were simply more than mindless creatures.  Unable to live with himself, he begged his companion (which was really [[Zezebazum]]) to end his life and allow him to rejoin his loved ones.  [[Zezebazum]] triumphant in bringing to his knees one of the greatest [[Elves|Elf]] of [[The Third Age]], informed Mathu'eire that this was a grave and sullen path that he was traveling - and joining his family would bring nothing but darkness and more despair.  Grief stricken, Mathu'eire begged to join his family - and [[Zezebazum]] obliged by turning him into the [[Kiraga]] Iraki - an unliving entity capable of cheating death and spawning creature of death and destruction for his companions.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Notable People/The Keep/Deepwater/jacob-jedaleon.jpg]]
Jacob Jadaleon III (c. 957 [[AAP]] - 1025 [[AAP]]) was the [[Emperor]] of [[The Viridian Empire]].  Ruler of the [[Kell]] and the [[Amoni|The Amoni People]] and the [[Uskardeen]].  He was [[Marshall]] of [[The Keep]], [[Shield]] of [[Deepwater]] and head of [[House Jedaleon]].  He is the father of [[Galad Jedaleon]], [[Greco Jedaleon]], and [[Natalia Jedaleon]].

The only son of [[Jayce Jedaleon II]] and [[Freya Bryne]], Jacob was groomed for rule.  He served as ward to his uncle [[Huster Bryne]], along with [[Orm Karbold]].  The two wards learned swordplay and political matters while becoming good childhood friends.  In these young tender years Jacob fell ill and was on his deathbed.  He asked for his last rites and confessed his sins, and miraculously recovered.

Jacob assumed the throne and was known as a patron of the arts.  He commissioned great works such as the [[Tower Of Deepwater]], [[The Deepwater Naval Academy]] and the [[The Temple Of The Divine]].

Jacob later married [[Katerin Karbold]], sister of [[Orm Karbold]].  This was a marriage of love, not political convenience.  He was promised at a young age to [[Lara Conlon]], of [[Derby]] to continue in solidifying the thin alliance between [[House Jedaleon]] and [[House Bryne]].  His rebuke caused what became known as [[The Siege Of Derby]], as [[The Fisher's League]] ceased trade relations with [[The Viridian Empire]].

He and [[Katarin Karbold]] had beautiful children, yet she died in childbirth in 1017 [[AAP]].  Jacob entered a severe depression over losing the love of his life, which he continued to suffer from until his death.

He died in 1025 [[AAP]] during the events of [[The Black Night]].</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Notable People/Stone Lands/Brand/jakus-saxon.jpg]]

Jakus (979 [[AAP]] - Current) is the is the Lord [[Shield]] of [[Brand]], [[Bannerman]] to [[House Anwyn]], and the head of [[House Saxon]]. He is known to be strict and stern, but just. Jakus respects the need for discipline and the chain of command, and is harsh on those in his service who do not. He has seen battle, and is a skilled commander - and often runs the city as if it is a garrison. He is a blood relative (nephew) to his liege Lord [[Keltar Anwyn]].

At the age of 29 he fought in [[The War Of The Shores]], where he was called into battle to defend against [[Orcish|Orc]] tribes who were ravaging the coast of [[The Viridian Empire]].  In battle he slayed [[Xarpug The Large]], a [[Troll]] who was terrorizing the citizens of [[The Golden Shores]]; earning him accommodations from the [[Emperor]] known as [[&quot;The Warrior's Heart&quot;|The Warrior's Heart]].

Jakus is strong of will and stubborn, however is very slow to anger.  He has much love for his son [[Janus Saxon]], who he wishes to have the strength and nobility worthy of [[House Saxon]].  When his wife, [[Iyla Thorson]] died in 1005 [[AAP]] to [[The Red Pox]], he grew more distant and cold of heart.  He would often seek solitude, or release his frustration on the training ground.

Jakus is a proud man, but not too proud to accept help in defending the needs of [[Brand]].  He works closely with [[The Grey Companions]] and [[The Crimson Order]], wishing only the best for his people.  Although many close to him would say he favors [[The Grey Companions]], even more so now that his son [[Janus|Janus Saxon]] is dating [[Minerva Carrington]].  Jakus approves of their relationship, seeing a positive change in [[Janus|Janus Saxon]] - and enjoying seeing his son truly happy.

When Jakus is around [[Minerva Carrington]] and [[Janus|Janus Saxon]], he suddenly transforms into a much softer, much happier, joyful man.  Their relationship reminds him of the fond times he had with [[Ilya Thorson]], and he is living vicariously through them.  He keeps pestering them on when they will get married, and insists that he takes care of all of the details.  He looks forward to the day he is a grandfather, and would be proud to have [[Minerva Carrington]] as a daughter.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Notable People/Stone Lands/Brand/janus-saxon.jpg]]

Janus Saxon (1000 [[AAP]] - Current) is the son of [[Jakus Saxon]] of [[House Saxon]] and [[Iyla Thorson]] of [[House Thorson]].  He lives with his father in the city of [[Brand]] and is in love with [[Minerva Carrington]].  They have been in a relationship for nearly a year, and it has become very public as the two of them are some of the most famous people in [[Brand]].  The citizens love them, and they are the city's power couple.

As a noble in line to inherit his father's position - he carries himself with a sense of entitlement which can be off putting to those who interact with him.  Raised in privilege he is overconfident, and considers those not of noble birth beneath him, something [[Minerva Carrington]] is grooming out of him.

As a young child, Janus was very close to his mother [[Iyla Thorson]].  They would attend church together, and he has fond memories of her charity work with the less fortunate of [[Brand]]; she would provide food, clothing, and in a few instances shelter for those in the most need.  Her devotion to [[The Gods]] was so great that she was gifted with [[Divine Power]].  He remembers the final kiss that she gave him when he was only five years old and she left the house for the last time to care for others in [[Brand's|Brand]] most dire time of need, a strange virus known as [[The Red Pox]] in 1005 [[AAP]].  This outbreak was resistant to [[Magic]], but that did not deter her; she cared for the sick and poor within [[The Warrens]] and herself became ill.  She succumbed to the illness, changing [[Jakus|Jakus Saxon]] and Janus's lives forever, but being memorialized by those of [[The Warrens]] as [[The Mother Of Brand]].

He grew up a bitter child with a father who was overly strict and harsh due to sorrow.  Janus despised [[The Warrens]] for taking his mother from him both in name and in body.  This made him smug and unbearable, traits his father could not correct with discipline; despite his best efforts.  He remained this way for some time, until he first heard the calling of [[Xander]].  Remarkably, he hears the voice of [[Xander]] when in times of stress and peril; driving him towards a life of [[Religion]] in the service of [[The Divine Order]].  He has become a devout [[Cleric]] of [[Xander]], imbued with [[Divine Favor]] like his mother.

He has grown from a petulant boy to a driven, focused, disciplined, and ambitious young man.</pre>

<div title="Kaethu" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="201602030126" modified="202006211714" tags="GURPS" changecount="4">
<pre>[&gt;img[images/items/combat-styles/kaethu.jpg]]
Kaethu, or &quot;Water Dancing&quot;, is a fighting style focusing on combat with a [[Kahedafa]] &quot;dancing sword&quot;.  It is considered a form of combat as well as a performing art prevalent in [[The Sylvan Empire]].  It is characterized by fast acrobatic maneuvers, including cartwheels and somersaults.  Striking techniques are works of beauty and terrible power.  The acrobatics serve as feints; one never knows what to expect from a Kaethu master.  Perfected by [[Elves|Elf]] during [[The Sylvan Empire]] in [[The Third Age]], it remains prevalent among portions of the [[Variona'Sha]].

''Kaethu (Physical/Hard)''
This represents the skill in Kaethu, and allows the character to learn the maneuvers of this style.  Additionally, it grants the use of the [[Kahedafa]] &quot;dancing sword&quot; in both the one and two handed variants.  Swing damage is increased by 1 when swinging the sword two-handed.  Parry when used one handed is 1/2 skill.  Used two-handed, and carrying no more than Light Encumbrance, Parry is 2/3 skill.  This style teaches a fighting stance that is resistant to Slam attacks or attempts to knock the fighter down.  Resist with a bonus of 1/10 this skill.

''Acrobatics''
Practitioners of Kaethu are skilled Acrobats and required to take the Acrobatics skill. see [B48]

''Parry Missile Weapons (Physical/Hard)''
Allows the parry of a missile or thrown weapon.  A character with Toughness + 2 or higher, or wearing armored gloves may parry with their hands.  Arrows are parried at no penalty; darts and crossbow bolts are parried at -5.  Thrown hand weapons are easy to parry for someone with this skill; +2 for knives, +4 for larger weapons.  The actual Parry is 1/2 the Parry Missile Weapons Skill.

''Hit Location [Kahedafa] (Hard)''
This maneuver lets the attacker reduce the penalties for aiming at a hit location using a [[Kahedafa]] &quot;dancing sword&quot;.  One does not roll against the Hit Location maneuver to use it; instead, each level of Hit Location gives the attacker a bonus that can be used to offset hit location penalties.  This bonus is +1 if Hit Location is known at Skill-2, +2 if it is known at Skill-1, and +3 if it is known at Skill.  No further improvement is possible.  This bonus can never result in the attack being made at a higher level than the prerequisite skill; it can //only// be used to offset hit location penalties.

''Stop Hit [Kahedafa] (Hard) - cannot exceed Kahedafa skill ''
This is an attack launched at the same time an enemy attacks!  The combatant using the Stop Hit is effectively surrendering his Active Defense.  On the other hand, the original attacker cannot defend either, unless he abandons his attack and tries to use an Active Defense; if he does that, he is still at -1 to defend against the Stop Hit.
If both fighters press on with their attacks, roll a Quick Contest between the attacker's weapon skill and the defender's Stop Hit; the one with the highest Move gets a +1 on the contest.  The winner rolls to hit first; if he hits and does damage, assess any shock and stunning penalties on the wounded character and //halve// them before applying them to his own attack.  Even if the wound is enough to stun the enemy, he can still roll for his attack, at -4 or minus the damage taken, whichever is higher.  On a tie, rolls to hit and damage are taken simultaneously, with effects taking place in the following turn.
This maneuver can result in both fighters being killed or incapacitated, so is rarely used in lethal combat.  A character using a Stop Hit is very vulnerable to Ripostes and Feints; a common fencing tactic consists in inviting a Stop Hit with a Feint, and then attacking the off-balance character.  If someone uses a Stop Hit in response to a Feint, he is at -3 skill to resist the feint.

''Feint (Hard)''
This maneuver is identical to the feint described on [B105].  It can be raised up to four levels past the prerequisite level.</pre>

<pre>A Kahedafa is an [[Elven|Elf]] sword common to the [[Varigelle]] of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  It is long and slightly curved, with a two-handed grip that can be wielded either one or two handed during combat.  In [[Elvish]] the word Kahedafa is translated to &quot;dancing sword&quot;, as it was accompanied by a warrior trained in a unique fighting style known as [[Kaethu]] or &quot;water dancing&quot; that mixed graceful movements and powerful attacks.

When used two handed, the weapon does +1 swinging damage and when paired with [[Elvish]] fighting technique can parry with 2/3 skill.  Kahedafa are customarily sheathed in an ornate hardwood scabbard.  A scabbarded kahedafa was used against an unworthy enemy to subdue without killing.  The following statistics are for a kahedafa of Good quality, however most kahedafa were of Fine quality or better.

Kandar is one of [[The Old Gods]], as old as time itself.  Legends depict Kandar as a large serpent-like creature with three eyes in its head and many eyes along its endless infinite body.  It lies within a layer of [[The Abyss]] filled with salt water and rocky prominences used as rookeries by winged [[Dathairä]].

Kandar has outgrown the layer of [[The Abyss]] it calls home, and is imprisoned under its own mass and size.  Kandar slumbers, awaiting to build enough power and energy to expand its territory.

!Worship
The worshipers of Kandar are more likely to be scaly things that hide from the light that [[Humans|Human]] or members of other civilized [[Races]] create.  Despite Kandar's stature in [[The Abyss]], the vast majority of [[Asha]] are blissfully ignorant of its existence.  A slim few have heard of it's name in whispers and nothing more.  Only scholars, arcanists, and those with a particular interest in [[The Old Gods]] know who and what it is.</pre>

|![[Guide To Roleplaying A Kell]]|
|![[Click Here For Information on The Old Tongue|The Old Tongue]]|

Kells are nomadic barbarians located in the Northwestern highlands of [[Kellos]].  They are rugged, burly, and strong folk who live in some of the more wild regions of the world.  They can be treated with disdain in the civilized parts of [[Asha]], due to the rare incidents where their tribes cause friction with established cities of [[The Northlands]].  [[The Westron Wall]] was originally built to keep their civilization at bay before [[The Viridian Empire]] occupied [[The Northlands]].  Their culture has been relegated to the more northern regions of [[Kellos]], and some tribes have been culturally absorbed into [[The Viridian Empire]], settling into small villages of their own.

The Kells live a harsh and simple life among the mountainous northern regions of [[Kellos]].  They are descendants of [[The First Men]] to walk upon [[Asha]] in [[The Second Age]], and their culture has remained relatively unscathed.  In their ancient traditions, they do not fear their own death, pain, or suffering - although they are very superstitious.  They have a deep belief in fate and destiny.  Kells can prove useful allies, but never turn to them in weakness.  They are as hard and unforgiving as the mountain stone in which they live.  If you approach in strength, they might consider you a worthy ally.

Kellish hunters speak of stories of the [[Burgonya]], creatures that are half human, half animal - and prey on flesh in the darkest nights.  Every day brings challenge to the Kell.  Food, water, and shelter are rare in their mountainous homes - a single mistake can bring down an entire tribe, while an individual's heroic effort can ensure the entire group's survival.  The Kell take pride in individualistic skill and self-sufficiency.  They love to win, but see defeat as a prod to improve themselves.

For Kell, competition is a means to measure talent, dedication, and effort.  While they will seek any advantage possible, they recognize that reliance on concepts like magic items or money are fickle and fleeting.  The Kell are careful to remember that those that rely too much on them can grow complacent, a recipe for disaster in the mountains.  Their culture has many tales of foolish Kell who relied too heavily on something other than their own innate strength and skill.  This trait manifests most strongly when the Kell interact with other cultures.  The relationship between peasant and noble puzzles the Kell.  If a king lacks the intelligence or leadership to lead, then clearly the most talented person in the kingdom should take his place.  Kell rarely keep such opinions to themselves, and mock folk who rely on society's structures or rules to maintain power. 

Younglings are not named until they are old enough to wield a weapon.  At that time, they participate in the rite of passage of receiving their name.  Once an adult, they are expected to contribute or be expelled from the tribe.  A lone Kell has little chance of survival, especially an older or weaker one.  Kell have little pity for adults who can't take care of themselves, though a sick or injured individual is treated, as a result of the concept of fair play.  A permanently injured Kell is still expected to pull his or her weight in the tribe.  Typically, such a Kell dies attempting to keep up, or slips away in the night to seek the cold will of fate.  This creates a drive to die in battle at peak physical condition rather than wither in the slow decay of old age.

Kells still speak [[The Old Tongue]] of [[The First Men]] they were descended from, yet there is no written form of this language.</pre>

Kikasha, roughly translated from [[Elvish]] as &quot;Dark Glory&quot; is a [[Kiraga]] sworn to [[Azarad-Ji]] that aided in [[The Third Desecration]].  His real name is lost to history, but it is known that he was a great [[Varigelle]] general during [[The Sylvan Empire]].  It is said that as a young [[Varigelle]] he jumped in front of a [[Wyvern]] attack to save the life of his commanding officer.  The poisonous sting struck him deep in the chest, and wounded him gravely.  Only the power of the great healers and his strong constitution saved him from the mortal wound.  From that day forward, he took the [[Wyvern]] as a crest.

Later in life, as a general of the [[Varigelle]],  Kikasha was faced with an invading army of [[Orc]].  It was the [[Dathairä]] [[Zezebazum]] who provided the [[Orc]] with the will to throw themselves against the defenses of [[The Sylvan Empire]] in the form of a large and ferocious [[Hydra]].  The invading army was formidable and many [[Elves|Elf]] were dying.  [[Zezebazum]], posing as a sage and historian, offered the whereabouts of a mystic sword to Kikasha, but warned against it's use.  Falling prey to [[Zezebazum]]'s manipulation, the warnings go unheeded, and he wins the battle but looses his soul to the evil magic [[Zezebazum]] beguiled into the sword.</pre>

<pre>The Kiraga (translation Fallen To The Darkness in [[Elvish]]) are eight fallen [[Forana'loloKashira]] that brought upon [[The Third Desecration]] that destroyed [[The Sylvan Empire]].  Each were lured into there transformation by [[Zezebazum]], an agent of [[Azarad-Ji]].  He beguiled and manipulated the fears, wickedness, and doubts within each [[Elf]] - their transformation being under their own free will rather than forced. 

[[Zezebazum]] meant for [[Raime Wesewierë]] to be the final Kiraga.  [[Raime Wesewierë]] had witnessed the corruption of [[The Sylvan Empire]] and began preaching of the impending doom if a new course was not set.  [[Zezebazum]], offered the power for others to do as he bid - but [[Raime Wesewierë]] refused him.  [[Zezebazum]] intended to use the power to corrupt [[Raime|Raime Wesewierë]], and transform him into the cornerstone Kiraga - master of the others.

She begged [[Zezebazum]] for her wicked thoughts back, who did so a hundred fold.  This sadistic creature is invested with the [[Divine Favor]] of [[Azarad-Ji]].|

Full of wrath, [[Vawene]] saw [[Zezebazum]] as a rival, until [[Zezebazum]] revealed the secret to beauty, a salve to be applied liberally to the skin.

Her transformation gave her horns, and wings - and charm and control spells to ensnare the opposite sex.  The favor [[Zezebazum]] asked, was to convert [[Raime Wesewierë]] to a Kiraga.|

Her closest companion is her black [[Dire Wolf]] named Belebha (&quot;Powerful Storm&quot; in [[Elvish]]), who remains protectively at her side at all times.

The [[Fomorians|Fomorian]] fear her wrath, which she gladly quenches with their blood.  She is a husk of her former self, fueled by anger and hate.  [[The Autumn Court]] once held their seat of power in [[Cenedriane]] (&quot;Twilight Breeze&quot; in [[Elvish]]) until it was lost in the war with the [[Fomorians|Fomorian]].

It was under the direction of Lady Selephra that the [[Garathira]] were created.  Twisted constructs of chitin and sinew that are powerful weapons used to protect the borders of [[The Autumn Court]].

<pre>The Larabira or &quot;Birth Of The Divine&quot; in [[Elvish]] is a text written by [[Elven|Elf]] prophet [[Raime Wesewierë]] concerning the creation of [[The Gods]] and [[Asha]].

----
What follows is a fragment of the Larabira
----

//These are the words [[Lucian]] spoke to [[Raime Wesewierë]] concerning the creation of [[Asha]]:

&quot;[[Umwe]] opened his eyes and gazed upon his void.  He filled his void with swirling lights, colors and sound.  And this pleased [[Umwe]] for a time.  [[Umwe]] then created his children, and they created great works of art and music in his name.  They sculpted, danced, painted and sang.  And this pleased [[Umwe]].

Four of [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children stood highest in his favor.  [[Kombar]] was an accomplished sculptor.  [[Lucian]] painted with fantastic colors.  [[Qualok]] sang and wrote poetry.  [[Xander]] was a master of dance.

[[Valouria]] arrived when the four were presenting their newest creations to [[Umwe]].  She was not a child of [[Umwe]], and not of this realm.  She was startled, and spoke a strange and unknown tongue.  [[Valouria]] quickly learned their tongue and was able to join her voice with theirs.  She was an exotic beauty who inspired all who laid eyes on her.  Her voice, her dance, and her beauty added to the harmony and this pleased [[Umwe]].

And [[Umwe]] placed [[Valouria]] at the most prominent position in his assembly, and her voice became the melody, her dance and art the centerpiece.  [[The Void]] was filled with beauty the likes of which will never be seen or heard again until the end of [[The Eternal Cycle]].

As their creation progressed, there was a discord.  A dark tone began creeping into the composition, and [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children were frightened.  Most fearful was [[Valouria]], who was the source of the discordance.

And it then came to be that [[Umwe]] found the dark seed inside of her, [[Valouria]] was giving birth to her own child.  Her eyes went black and body limp, all of [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children ceased creating.  From within her, [[Azarad-Ji]] called out to [[Umwe]] &quot;I am the destroyer from [[beyond the void|The Abyss]].  Hidden within this innocent child is your undoing.  Behold!&quot;

[[Azarad-Ji]] burst from [[Valouria]], killing her.  His appearance sickened [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children.  [[Qualok]] and [[Kombar]] rushed to [[Valouria's|Valouria]] side, while [[Xander]] and [[Lucian]] moved to restrain [[Valouria's|Valouria]] twisted offspring.

A fierce battle ensued in which [[Azarad-Ji]] severed one of [[Kombar's|Kombar]] hands, and blinded [[Umwe]].  It was [[Azarad-Ji]] who pierced [[The Void]], allowing his [[Dathairä]] to pour through.  Great losses were had on both sides of the struggle, ending with [[Umwe]] gravely wounded and [[Azarad-Ji]] subdued.

[[Kombar]] sculpted three mighty golems to assist him in crafting a prison for [[Azarad-Ji]] and a tomb for the beloved [[Valouria]].  The first golem was of stone, named [[Golthon]].  The second was of metal, named [[Stellath]].  The third was forged from crystal, named [[Zenriah]].

[[Azarad-Ji]] was beaten but not destroyed, and locked for an eternity in a prison of [[Kombar's|Kombar]] making.

When [[Xander]] lay [[Valouria]] within her magnificent tomb, each of [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children kissed her cheek.  [[Kombar]] named her tomb [[Asha]], and [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children decorated it with flowing water, and beautiful gardens.&quot;

And when she had ended her telling, [[Raime Wesewierë]] paused for a long while.  He then said &quot;Much you tell of the time before [[Asha]], and of [[Umwe]] and his children.  Yet you do not tell of the nature of [[Azarad-Ji]] and [[Valouria]] - from whence they came.&quot;

Lucian continued &quot;It came to be known that [[Azarad-Ji]] and [[Valouria]] were from [[beyond the void|The Abyss]].  A [[domain of chaos|The Abyss]] outside of [[Umwe's|Umwe]] direct control, as even [[Umwe]] must obey [[The Eternal Cycle]].

Now all is said to thee, [[Raime Wesewierë]], concerning the manner of [[Asha]] before the days it became such as [[our children|Races]] have known it.  Of [[our children|Races]] you have not asked, yet I will parlay as to make an end.

The [[Elves|Elf]] are my children, born of [[The Astral Stream]] and gifted with all of the beauty and grace I could afford.  As with [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children, I gifted them with everlasting life, less they die from sorrow or are slain.  And dying they gather in [[The Fields Of Kalara]].  From [[Kombar]] were born the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], strong mighty and bold.  It is not fully understood by me how [[Humans|Human]] entered into [[Asha]], they appeared as if part of the artifice, and none of [[Umwe's|Umwe]] children dared add anything to their fashion.

[[Umwe]] uttered these words before closing his eyes &quot;Behold the beauty of [[Asha]], and the earthly creatures that reside.  They shall conceive more beauty than any of my children.&quot;

And this, [[Raime Wesewierë]], is all I will say for now.&quot;//</pre>

!Places Of Interest
* [[Flak’s Flagon]] is one of the best inns in Laranor.  Flak is very attentive to his customers, and keeps a close eye on the patrons.  Having a large troll in the establishment does wonders for keeping customers in-line.
* [[The Lantern]] is a competing inn/tavern within the city.  It is run by a large pasty faced [[Bandorian|Bandor]] named Hestus who inflates all of his prices to encourage bargaining.
* [[The Golden Dice]] is a nightclub and gambling hall.  It is not as good as those in larger cities, but those wishing to try their luck will be presently surprised at the assortment of games.  The rumor is the games are all rigged.
* [[Madam Tralgar’s]] is a brothel.  Madam Tralgar is a [[Darkling]] with connections to some of the more influential [[Deepwater]] [[Darkling Cloaks|Darkling Cloak]].  She is always trying to play sides, attempting to keep her girls busy with underworld customers.  One can find any type of girl they desire here.
* [[The Temple Of Laranor]] was built ages ago by the [[Elves|The Sylvan Empire]] when they once occupied the lands.  The second floor boasts a statue that was carved by the [[Elves|Elf]] themselves.  No [[Human]] is aware of who it is, but it appears to be a likeness of an [[Elven prophet|Raime Wesewierë]].

<pre>A Lich is the undead form of a powerful [[magician|Magic]] who has sought to preserve their life through unnatural means.  Typically, entering Lichdom requires a great deal of [[Mana]] that requires one drains it from surrounding life-force - meaning becoming a Lich needs the sacrifice of living things; an evil act.  This process generally results in a gaunt skeletal being with withered flesh stretched tight across horribly visible bones. 

A Lich places their essence into a [[Phylactery]], which if destroys kills them forever.  A Lich will stop at nothing to protect their [[Phylactery]].  As long as this [[Phylactery]] is unharmed, the Lich was immortal and would be able to reassemble if it was every vanquished.

The Lindworm is native to the coast of [[Amon]] in the warmer waters of [[The Risen Reef]].  They are aquatic serpent creatures with heads like a dragon, long snake-like bodies with two small arms used for purchase on the rocky sea floor.  Pearl divers and seafloor scavengers sometimes tell tales of mysterious ocean gardens filled with statues of sea creatures and sailors - the underwater grottoes of the deadly Lindworm.

<pre>Although magic is not a staple of everyday life for most of the people of [[Asha]], it is not considered uncommon.  No one expects to see a mad sorceress running down the streets throwing fireballs, but maybe the local doctor is a wizard with lots of healing spells.  Most mages live relatively normal lives as teachers, entertainers or country “hedge wizards”.  There are a few who go out and get themselves caught up in adventures, become mercenaries or join militias.   Some enter into politics, as many are wealthy with high status. But that is uncommon because mages simply love the study and practice of their art.  And being that it is quite easy for a mage to make a living just about anywhere he goes just by performing magic (either for entertainment or service), most choose to stay in one place, sometimes never venturing far from home.

This is not to say that all mages are lily white with honest intentions, when wizards do get out of line it tends to be taken very seriously.  When magic is used to harm the innocent, or magical experimentation brings about disaster for a town: people get upset.  When a wizard creates problems with his magic (whether its accidental or not) that gets causes trouble in a town, the city guard will come after that wizard (if the lynch mob doesn’t get him first) right after they repair the damage.

In ages past, [[Cyril Viridian]] outlawed the use [[Magic]] and mages were hunted and killed in a war known as [[Azutan Nagyos]].  Since then, the law was amended and mages have once again come out into the open and have been productive members of society.  There are those who still harbor the historical [[Intolerance For Magic]], but those people are rare and far between - or keep their mouth shut.

To sum it up very simply, mages can fit into almost any aspect of society.  Common folk think of magic as a great skill that’s hard to learn and can do a lot of great things.  People won’t expect to see a mage every day but won’t be shocked or terrified when they do.  Most wizards are considered pleasant and the bad apples don’t ruin the bunch.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Notable People/Stone Lands/magnus-zizorum.jpg]]

Magnus Zizorum (985 [[AAP]] - Current) is a [[Sorcerer]] and [[Warlock]] who operates within the region of [[The Stone Lands]] in [[The Viridian Empire]].  Bald and aged, Magnus is nonetheless a physically impressive man made all the more powerful-seeming by his considerable charisma, commanding voice, and determined manner.  While he rarely looks relaxed or at ease, he occasionally flashes an amused smile or more often a sneer.  His is equally powerful in both [[Sorcery]] and [[Blood Magic]], which shows upon his body; his eyes are red and bloodshot, and his skin grey and covered with dark black veins.  Often he uses incantations to hide this appearance, due to his vanity.

Magnus is driven and has little time for what he deems to be unimportant and insignificant such as politics.  He will stop at nothing in order to achieve his goals and get what he desires.  He sides with [[Azarad-Ji]] and [[Desecration]], not as a fanatic zealot but as a self proclaimed realist.  He sees the endgame in which the forces of [[Desecration]] need only succeed once, and defending the world from destruction can grow intensely tiring.  It's logic which makes him want to ensure there is a place of power for him when the world crumbles.

It was Magnus that used [[Blood Magic]] to restore the eyesight of [[Desini Orosco]] in order to curry favor with her and her younger sister, whom he was attempting to recruit in the backwater village of [[Wayfaire]].  The two girls ran off with him into his lair in the mountains, where it was the younger sister [[Lyla Orosco]] who first fell victim to his charms.  The two had a baby together, [[Erik Orosco|Erik Doorhaus]].  Magnus's plan all along was to use this baby as a sacrifice in a [[Blood Magic]] ritual to [[Urdlen]] in order to achieve immortality.  He failed due to the heroics of [[Desini Orosco]], who absconded with the baby never to return.  [[Lyla|Lyla Orosco]] unfortunately died in the ritual.

Desini sought [[The Grey Companions]] in the city of [[Brand]] for help.  They tracked down Magnus and killed him in 1009 [[AAP]], only for Magnus to mysteriously reappear in 1020 [[AAP]] and trap and kill [[The Grey Companions]] [[Rog]], [[Dargay]], [[Malden Bray]], [[Chandi]], and [[Sanders]] in a rift to [[The Shadow Lands]] the village of [[Abermaw]].

Magnus has a second son [[Malochai Zizorum]] who appears to be a twin of his son [[Erik|Erik Doorhaus]].  His origin is a mystery.

In a confrontation with [[Desini Orosco]], Magnus was subdued and fitted with an [[Enchanted|Enchantment]] collar which prevents the wearer from using [[Sorcery]] and [[Wizardry]]; however he escaped with a flourish of [[Blood Magic]] and remains at large.</pre>

Martin Blackbriar was the official head of [[House Blackbriar]] and [[Shield]] of [[Duskstone]].  Martin was a master [[Vampire]], slain by [[Desini Orosco]] and [[Minerva Carrington]] of [[The Grey Companions]] in 1021 [[AAP]].  He was of unknown age, and was known to assume the identity of a &quot;son&quot; whom was often an abducted boy.  In 1021 [[AAP]] he was masquerading as Lord Martin Blackbriar IV.

He was tall, strong and statuesque.  His black hair framed his chiseled, handsome face - which was adorned with a well groomed goatee.  After orchestrating a plot to gain more prestige for his house in [[The Siege Of Derby]], he forced [[Derya Carrington]] into a marriage against her will and &quot;adopted&quot; [[Frederick Carrington]] as his son.  [[Derya|Derya Carrington]] was miserable as the object of affection for this creature - having lost her loving husband and [[House]].  She threw herself from the top of the tower, and died.

Melaniacha'hogga is a form of ritual combat practiced by the [[Variona'Sha]].

The [[Variona'Sha]] never fight amongst themselves.  Instead they practice Melaniacha’hogga, which is a six on six battle of ritualistic combat.  The two [[clans|Variona'Sha Clans]] in dispute square off in a no holds barred competition.

One of the [[Variona'Sha]] is chosen as the team Dostanna, or leader.  The Dostanna must wear a necklace with the symbol of their [[clan|Variona'Sha Clans]].  If this necklace is removed by the opposing team, the Dostanna and his team are considered defeated.  All combatants must remove any armor before the competition, and only weapons without an edge or point are admitted.  Missile weapons are allowed, but frowned upon and considered taboo.

An annual competition is held, and all [[clans|Variona'Sha Clans]] attend.  The winning [[clan|Variona'Sha Clans]] gains a [[leading voice|Chief Of Chiefs]] over the actions of all of the remaining tribes.  This competition is entitled ‘[[The Rite Of Sha]]’.

Milkfish are not really fish at all.  They are large mammals which live in shallow and sandy places along seashores, grazing on seaweed.  They have squat ugly faces covered with whiskers, thick, bony front limbs used for digging and balancing themselves in the water, and long lumpy bodies which end in a flat whale-like tail.  The hide is tough and leathery, with thick blubber underneath.  Their only attack is an ineffectual tail-slap.

They are extremely easy to domesticate, Enterprising herders have found that in addition to the rich milk that gives the animals their name, milkfish meat is tender and tasty, and the fatty layer underneath the tough outer skin can be used to make useful oils.

Minerva (c. 1003 [[AAP]] to Current) was a player character run by [[Elizabeth Disbrow]]

Minerva grew up in what is affectionately called [[The Warrens]] in the city of [[Brand]].  [[The Warrens]] are the cramped, dirty slums of the city located near the lower docks.  Filthy and poor, Minerva lived off of the scraps left by the rich merchants and caravans moving goods through the ports of the city.

She eventually joined up with a few upstart treasure hunters, which included her childhood friends [[Drold Lorin]] (a [[Darkling]]) and [[Lommy Loamfoot]] (a [[Bairn]]) as well as Drold's cousin.  She found herself exploring subterranean tombs and ruins for bits of leftover treasure.  This life suited her well, until betrayed by [[Drold Lorin]] and his cousin - ending in the death of her good friend [[Lommy Loamfoot]].  She carries with her a pair of ornate daggers, relics from [[The Sylvan Empire]], found on the adventure in which her friend died.

Minerva stayed in the city of [[Brand]], helping those less fortunate than herself.  She became known as &quot;The Red Queen&quot; - a vigilante for hire.  Later she met up with [[Erik Doorhaus]] and [[Desini Orosco]], and joined [[The Grey Companions]] in 1009 [[AAP]].

She later learned she was a member of [[House Carrington]] and was rescued at birth when her family was murdered in a take over plot of [[Hagen]] during [[The Siege Of Derby]].</pre>

<pre>Mordayn Vapor is a drug made of roughly ground leaves of a rare herb found in deep forests, mardayn is so potent that it is taken by steeping a small amount in hot water and then inhaling the vapors of the resultant tea.  Raw mordayn powder and mordayn-tainted water are deadly poison; taking the powder directly or drinking the water produces an immediate overdose.  It is renowned for the beautiful visions it induces and the deadly peril of its sinister embrace.

''Initial Effect:'' Exotic visions of incredible beauty enthrall the user for the next d20+10 minutes.  During this time the user must make a Wisdom save of 12 or lose any action they attempt.
''Side Effect:'' The visions are incredibly beautiful and poignant.  The user's normal life seems drab an futile in comparison, and they ache to experience the transcendent beauty of the drug-induced dreams again.  When the dose wears off, the user must make a Wisdom save of DC 17 or fall under a compulsion to do whatever is necessary to repeat another dose (treat as a compulsion similar to that of the suggestion spell).  This compulsion lasts for 1d4 hours before fading.
''Overdose:'' If two doses are taken within the space of an hour, or if raw Mordayn Powder or Mordayn Tea are ingested, the drug is a deadly poison (ingested DC 17, 2d10 damage).  Mordayn vapod addicts often throw out the tea as soon as they inhale and make sure that only one dose is available at a time in order to make sure they cannot overdose on the deadly drug.</pre>

!Introduction
The Mordmarr'Khan (translated from [[Dwarvish]] as &quot;The Undermountain Papacy&quot;) is one of the oldest religious institutions in the world.  It plays a prominent role in all [[Dwarf]] [[Strongholds|Stronghold]] and politics.  The Papacy worships [[Kombar]], the patron of the [[Kombar'Ran]], and is headed by the [[Horm'Kestaz]] or &quot;Supreme Holy&quot;, who has supreme power over the church.

At age 15, a select group of [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] children become wards of the church, and are given the title of [[Volg'gogan]] or &quot;Stone Blessed&quot;.  They are seen as a deadly contingent of a [[Stronghold's|Stronghold]] defense - possessing both might and [[Magic]].  They are blessed with the [[Divine Favor]] of [[Kombar]].

!Doctrine
Papacy doctrine has developed over the centuries, reflecting an amalgam of ancient teachings and modern sensibilities.  The church believes that it is continually guided by [[Kombar]] and is therefore infallible from error when a firm decision is reached.  Doctrine is documented in a tome called the [[Var'Valaszok]] or &quot;Eternal Answers&quot;.

!Beliefs
* Kombar forged [[Asha]], and the prison that holds [[Azarad-Ji]]
* It is believed that the first [[Stronghold]] was built by [[Kombar]] himself.  [[Kombar's Lost Stronghold]] is now lost to history.
* When a [[Dwarf]] dies, he becomes a warrior of [[Kombar]].  This is called being &quot;returned to the stone&quot;.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Mysara/mysara.jpg]]

Mysara (46 [[IO]] to 29 [[AAP]]) was a prodigious user of [[Magic]] and a scholar of [[The Planes Of Existence]].  Although few details of her life are known, she is regarded as the first [[Human]] to explore [[Sene'Rine'Rada]], [[The Shadow Lands]], and [[The Astral Stream]].  She documented her work in a manual she dubbed the [[Codex Of The Infinite Planes]], still thought to be one of the most thorough examinations of other worlds.  She postulated the existence of dimensions beyond [[The Prime Material Plane]] that she never was able to make contact with - many of which have been discovered since.  She was known as the Lady of Shadowy Depths.

She called the area now known as [[The Dales]] her home, and saw to the safety and well being of its inhabitants.  When the wizard [[Armondax]] battled the [[Dragon]] [[Culdranth]] and caused the destruction of at least two hamlets and a city, Mysara stepped in.  This resulted in the beginning of a long running feud between two of the most powerful mages in the world.  Mysara found that [[Armondax]] was reckless and dangerous in his exploration of [[Magic]].

When [[The Demon Plague]] began, Mysara sought out [[Armondax]] believing him responsible for the death and destruction occurring to the people under her care.  After a brief but powerful exchange of magical combat, the two realized a darker magic was to blame.  Together they combined their magical talents to battle the cult known as [[The Holy Scourge]].  After a series of conflicts, they sent word to both [[Fazar]] and [[Waywill]], two equally powerful mages - and together the four of them brought an end to [[The Demon Plague]].

While the group managed to avert an impending [[Desecration]] locally, [[The Destruction Of Uskard]] saw to a surge of [[Uskardeen]] refugees come to [[Kellos]].  The near destruction at the hands of [[The Holy Scourge]], and inclusion of the magically gifted [[Uskardeen]] saw [[Cyril Viridian]] take power and overthrow [[The Old Republic]].  [[Cyril Viridian]] began the [[Azutan Nagyos]], a war against [[Magic]].  During this time the four mages founded what is now known as [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].  Banded together they fought against [[Cyril Viridian]], self appointed [[Emperor]] of [[Kellos]].  After a few years of fighting, the [[Azutan Nagyos]] ended - and magic was no longer outlawed.

In the peaceful years that followed, Mysara fell in love and married her once rival [[Armondax]].  Together they had a son who was himself a powerful wizard.</pre>

!Absorb Mind
|//''Required Components:'' A fresh or preserved (still bloody) 1-ounce portion of another creature's brain.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 10 minutes|
|''Range:'' Personal|
|''Duration:'' 1 minute / level|
The caster eats at least a portion of the brain of another creature's corpse.  By doing so, they gain the creature's memories and knowledge to some degree, so that they have a 25% chance of recalling any important fact known to the creature - family history, recent events, the general layout of the creature's stomping grounds, details about the creature's death, important plans, passwords, magic item command words, and similar tidbits.  Skills, feats, spells, and other such knowledge cannot be obtained in this fashion.
Once the caster rolls to determine whether they recall a fact, they cannot attempt to recall that fact again.  After the duration expires, the caster no longer has the ability to recall new facts from that creature.
When the duration is exhausted, the caster makes a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or takes 2d6 psychic damage.

!Absorb Strength
|//''Required Components:'' A fresh or preserved (still bloody) 1-ounce portion of another creature's flesh.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 10 minutes|
|''Range:'' Personal|
|''Duration:'' 10 minutes / level|
The caster eats at least a portion of the flesh of another creature's corpse, thereby gaining 1/4 of the creature's Strength score as an enhancement bonus to the caster's Strength score, and 1/4 of the creatures Constitution score.
When the duration is exhausted, the caster makes a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or takes 2d6 psychic damage.

!Death Grimace
|//''Required Components:'' A dead body.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 action|
|''Range:'' Touch|
|''Duration:'' Permanent|
The caster marks a corpse with a particular magical 'signature', often used as a sort of calling card or mark to prove they murdered the target.  The signature can take on many forms: a specific expression on the face of the corpse (hence the name of the spell), an actual rune, a word written on the corpse's flesh, a discoloration of one eye, and so on.
After casting, the caster takes 1 point of damage.

!Eye Of The Zombie
|//''Required Components:'' One [[Zombie]] with eyes soaked in brackish water.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 30 minutes|
|''Range:'' Personal|
|''Duration:'' 1 hour / level|
The caster replaces their eyes with the eyes of a [[Zombie]], allowing them to see through the [[Zombie's|Zombie]] empty eye sockets and control its actions directly.  The [[Zombie]] must be controlled by the caster.  The magic of this spell allows the caster to remove their own eyes (dealing 1d6 damage) and take a [[Zombie's|Zombie]] eyes that they have removed and soaked in a special bath of brackish water.  The caster's eyes are preserved by the spell while they control the [[Zombie]] and they perceive the world through it.  The caster's body remains motionless and is subject to harm normally.  When the spell ends, the caster's eyes automatically return to them.

!Possession / Soul Rider
|//''Required Components:'' Blood of the target.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 minute|
|''Duration:'' 1 minutes / level|
The caster must have the blood of the intended target, or be touching them.  The target makes a Wisdom saving throw at DC 13.  On a failure, the caster becomes able to see through the target's eyes, hear through their ears, etc. whenever they concentrate as an action.  The caster also remains aware of their own body and may act normally.  The caster can exert no control whatsoever over the subject, and does not know the subject's thoughts.  In the event that the ritual is finished and the target is no longer alive, the caster takes 2d10 psychic damage.
Once soul riding a target, the caster has the ability to attempt to gain control of the subject.  A contest of Wisdom is made - if the subject loses the caster now has control over all of the victim's physical actions (although the caster does not have access to the subject's memories, skills, spells, etc).  The subject retains their memory and wits and is aware of what is happening - though not of the caster's identity.  The caster can only &quot;animate&quot; the body, and must concentrate to control the subject's body.  When the caster concentrates, their own body falls limp; when they stop concentrating, the subject regains control of their own body again - but the caster can move between the bodies freely while the spell lasts.  The subject may continue to resist each round.  If the target rolls three successive failures, they can no longer resist for the remainder of the duration.  Any success by the target pushes the caster out of their body.
If the target can no longer resist, the caster has the ability to attempt to push further into their subconscious.  Another contest of Wisdom allows the caster to gain full control of the victim's memories, skills and spells - and use them as if they were their own while in the body.  The caster's own body lies unconscious during the remaining duration.  Again, a successful resistance pushes the caster from the target's body.
If the caster remains in control of the body for the full duration of the ritual, the possession is permanent.  The caster's own body enters a form of suspended animation (no need for food, air, sleep, etc).  If the caster's body dies, the spell is broken.  If the caster's body takes damage - the caster must roll a concentration check or be pushed from the victim's body.  If the victim's body dies - the caster must roll a Constitution saving throw DC 12 or die themselves.  When permanently possession a body this way, the caster may not switch between their own body and the victims - although they may choose to leave willingly and break the spell and return to their natural body.

!Preserve Organ
|//''Required Components:'' An organ.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 10 minutes|
|''Range:'' Touch|
|''Duration:'' 24 hours|
The caster preserves a single severed organ from a living creature so that it does not decay or rot.  Evil casters use preserved organs as material spell components.  There are ritual uses for body parts as well.
The organ is kept in the exact state it was in when the spell was cast.  If a heart is still beating and bloody, for example, then it remains that way.

!Raise Dead
|//''Required Components:'' A corpse that has not been buried.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 night|
|''Range:'' Touch|
|''Duration:'' Permanent|
Brings the subject back to life, provided that the body, or most of it is available.  The body must be prepared and buried with a fresh heart from a living creature placed inside the chest cavity of the corpse.  Over the course of a full night, the body will animate into an undead creation and dig itself from its grave.  The state of the corpse will determine the type of undead ([[Skeleton]] or [[Zombie]])

!Regenerate
|//''Required Components:'' A fresh body part.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 30 minutes|
|''Range:'' Touch|
|''Duration:'' Permanent|
This ritual can restore missing body parts (arms, legs) on living creatures.  The caster is required to have a fresh replacement part, which is consumed during the ritual.  The target has intense pain during the ritual as a skeletal version of the body part slowly sprouts and grows from their body, then muscles can be seen growing, followed by skin.  This can be used to heal burned areas as well.
Target rolls a Constitution saving throw DC 15 or takes 1d10 damage.

!Shadow Assassin
|//''Required Components:'' A soul.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 10 minutes|
|''Range:'' Touch|
|''Duration:'' 24 hours|
Summons a shadowy [[Bharguul]] assassin to do the caster's bidding.  Requires the soul of a living creature for the [[Bharguul]] to materialize and take the form of a human size black vapor.  While the [[Bharguul]] could be confused, it is ruthless in it's mission and will never listen to pleas or negotiation.  The Assassin lasts 24 hours unless first destroyed.

!Unliving Weapon
|//''Required Components:'' A drop of bile and a bit of sulfur.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 10 minutes|
|''Range:'' Touch|
|''Duration:'' 1 hour / level|
This ritual causes an undead creature to explode in a burst of powerful energy when struck for at least 1 point of damage, or at a set of time no longer than the duration of the spell - whichever comes first.  The explosion is a 10-foot radius burst that deals 1d6 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d6).
While this spell can be an effective form of attack against an undead creature, necromancers often use unliving weapon to create undead capable of suicide attacks.  [[Skeletons|Skeleton]] or [[Zombies|Zombie]] with this spell cast upon them can be very dangerous foes that would normally disregard them.</pre>

Nester Arkwood (c. 960 [[AAP]] - 1025 [[AAP]]) was the son of [[Tilden Arkwood]] and [[Cassandra Huntley]], [[Zylokian|Zylok]] [[Arkanus First Class]], [[Distinguished Magus]] of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]], [[Lord Magister]] of [[The Magian Imperium]].  He was the [[Headmaster]] of [[The Athenaeum]], and was known as one of the most powerful wizards in the world.

Wielder of [[The Shard Of Sakkrad]], Nester lists as one of his many achievements the rediscovery of [[Echantment]] and the invention of the [[Arkstones]] which due to [[The Triumph Initiative]] led to the invention of [[Airships|Airship]] in 1021 [[AAP]].

His discovery of [[Enchantment]] was an oddity, as it was jump started due to a time paradox caused by [[Erik Doorhaus]] and the creation of [[The Chrono Ocullum]] in 1023 [[AAP]].  [[The Grey Companions]] were thrust backwards in time, and spoke with Nester Arkwood when he was a teacher at [[The Athenaeum]]; seeding the discovery of [[Enchantment]].

He was slain by [[Harmost Xawn]] and [[Penelope Kensington]] on an attack of [[The Athenaeum]] in an attempt to bring about the resurrection of [[The Whispered One]] known as [[The Black Night]].</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Notable People/Stone Lands/Brand/nicholette.jpg]]

Nicholette is a young shy waif who serves [[The Grey Companions]]. She keeps quiet and to herself, tending to the cleaning and chores needed to keep the manor running. Since hiring her, the floors have been immaculate.

Nicholette was born an orphan, and has a soft spot for young children.  In her spare time, she secretly slips out of the house and makes her way to a local orphanage where she helps care for the children, donating her time and what little money she makes.  She is a creature of habit, and her life is very much routine.  She loves the repetition of waking, cleaning, serving, and working.

She is not comfortable being the focus of attention, and is quite nervous when spoken to directly.  She tugs and twirls her hair when nervous or afraid.  This makes her an awful liar, and she knows it.  The only exception is [[Erik Doorhaus]], whom for some reason she feels very comfortable around.  In part due to his young age, his [[Magic]] affinity, and his creative ideas.  She admires him and even finds him adorable.

Nicolette is naturally curious, and was born with an innate [[Sorcery]].  While her skill in [[Magic]] is very poor, she secretly spies on the classes that young [[Erik Doorhaus]] provides to the local gifted children.  While her curiosity of the secrets held within [[The Grey Companions]] vault are strong, her fear of [[Desini Orosco]] runs deeper.</pre>

}}}
When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or begin rolling Death Saving Throws, as explained in the following sections.

!Instant Death
Massive damage can kill you instantly.  When damage reduces you to 0 hit point and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.  For example, you have a maximum hit points of 12 and a current hit points of 6.  If you take 18 damage from an attack, you are reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains.  Because the remaining damage equals your hit point maximum, you die.

!Death Saving Throws
Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw called a Death Saving Throw to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang on to life.  Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.Roll a d20.  If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed.  Otherwise, you fail.  A failure results in you acquiring the Disabled condition (see below).  On your third success, you become Stable (see below).  Each failure results in a new condition until your third failure, where you die.  The success and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.  The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable

!Dying Conditions
Death conditions alter your capabilities in a variety of ways, and continue to worsen if you are not healed or stabilized.

''Disabled'' //NO FAILED DEATH SAVES//
You drop whatever you are holding and fall prone.Your may take no actions, bonus action or reactions and your only movement option is to crawl at a speed of 5 feet.Attack rolls against you have advantage.  You automatically fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

''Holding On'' //ONE FAILED DEATH SAVE//
You are incredibly weakened.  You can no longer crawl, and even talking is becoming challenging as you hold on to consciousness.  You can only speak one or two words at a time.

''On Death's Door'' //TWO FAILED DEATH SAVES//
You are unconscious and incapacitated, unaware of your surroundings.

''Stable'' //THREE SUCCESSFUL DEATH SAVES//
You are Unconscious.  Every hour, you must roll a Constitution Saving Throw (DC 10 + 1 per hour after the first) to remain stable.  If you fail the save, you again are dying and in the Holding On condition with a failed death save.

''Dead'' //THREE FAILED DEATH SAVES//
You are dead, and your soul immediately departs your body; getting the soul back requires access to [[powerful magic|Resurrection Magic]]</pre>

Nygotha is a malevolent entity, one of [[The Old Gods]] manifested as a slick black viscous liquid.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/orc.jpg]]
|![[Click Here For Information on the Orcish Language|Black Speech]]|

Orcs are squat, green skinned humanoids. Orcs have broad noses, pallid eyes, and broad mouths dominated by enlarged canine teeth.  Most Orcs stand about 5 ½ feet tall (height is 2” less on average than a [[Human]], weight is10 pounds heavier).  Their arms are long and powerful, their legs are bowed, and their hands and feet are broad and coarse.  Their skin is dark with a leathery texture.  Hair colors other than black are very rare.

!Search, Destroy, Repeat
Orcs conquer and take whatever they desire, even from one another.  They are built for survival in even the harshest of environments.  The only thing preventing the Orcs from taking over the world is their cultural inability to cooperate with or even tolerate others (including themselves).  Orcs are fearless fighters, every adult Orc knows how to battle with weapons.  Orcs believe that the world is intrinsically hostile, and that the only thing an individual can do is grab as much as he can while he’s alive and kill anything that tries to take it away from him.  Many Orcs are pathologically paranoid.

!Colors of Conquest
Orcs do not have any appreciation for esoteric or craft skills (unless they have to do with combat).  They do not understand or love beauty or art.  They do however decorate their surroundings with crude symbols of ownership or religion.  Three colors have special meaning to all orcs, and they adorn their bodies, possessions and lairs with pigments that produce these hues.  Red ochre is used to represent blood, grayish white ash to represent death, and charcoal to represent darkness.

!The Strongest and Most Cunning Lead
Orcs are very social creatures.  They gather in [[large tribes|Orcish Tribes]] and nations, but remain highly unorganized.  Their social structure is founded on strength, and the strongest tribe member leads.  No Orc has any rights, only privileges he has fought for.  Since the males are stronger, the females are usually abused.  Life is very hard for Orcish women.  Orcs revel in slavery.  They have subjugated the [[Troll]] race, but also have slaves of other races (including their own).  When two [[Orcish Tribes]] battle, the victor takes all surviving prisoners as slaves.  It must be said that life within an [[Orcish Tribe]] is a difficult power struggle.  Tribal members constantly attempt to undermine those of higher status, so that they themselves may personally acquire higher social standing.

!Cast Iron Stomach
Orcs have the ability to eat almost anything (gristle, spoiled milk, mildewed grain, half-rotten vegetables, fuzzy blue-green meat) as long as it's organic.  They also have the ability to distinguish between (and recognize) individuals, places and things by their odors.  Their sense of smell is far beyond the [[Human]] norm, and can determine distinctive odors for practically everything and anything they may encounter.  They may memorize an odor by sniffing it for at least one minute and making a successful Intelligence roll of DC 11.

!Omens and Superstitions
The Orcs have an affinity to [[Azarad-Ji]] and have adopted the language of [[Black Speach]], shared with the [[Dathairä]].  It is spoken from deep within the throat, making speech sound like guttural grunts and croaks.  Each tribe has a unique dialect, making communication between tribes difficult and troublesome.  When an Orc becomes skilled with a talent for [[Blood Magic]], they are given the respect and title of tribe [[Shaman|Orc Shaman]].  Only one [[Orc Shaman]] may exist for a tribe, so a [[shaman|Orc Shaman]] is expected to kill any potential rivals, or leave the tribe.  Solitary shamans are not uncommon, but they often dedicate their measly lives to plotting the death of a rival so they may rejoin a tribe.

The lands to the south of the ‘civilized’ portions of Asha are known as the Orcish Lands.  This harsh rugged terrain is hospitable only to the Orcs that thrive there.  [[Orcish Tribes]] have carved a pitiful excuse for civilization in a land full of quagmires, active volcanoes, and thick dense jungles.  [[Orcs|Orc]] have a unique physiology that allows them to sustain their bodies with food that is barely digestible by other races.

While the Otyugh are not [[Dathairä]], they do originate from [[The Abyss]].  They are known as The Dark Young Of [[Draizon]], as they are continuously birthed from [[The Old God|The Old Gods]], either consumed again into [[Draizon's|Draizon]] miasmatic form or escape to some monstrous life elsewhere.

The Otyugh are grotesque, bulbous creatures borne along on three sturdy legs, its sensory organs are set along a vine-like stalk that snakes from the top of its bloated body.  Thick snake like tentacles that end in spikey, leaf-like appendages are used to shovel food into its gaping maw.  They plod along on three sturdy legs, but are more content to wait in ambush in mounds of detritus and carrion, leaving only its sensory stalk exposed.  They smell putrid like rotting flesh.

These creatures are usually called upon to preside over cult ceremonies.  One means of summoning them is found in [[The Book Of Mig'dran]] and requires a blood offering.  Cultists have been able to extract what is called [[The Milk Of Draizon]] from these creatures - granting those that drink fierce and dark mutations.

!Description
Oxam is a newer city compared to those of equal size, first springing up as a way-stop on the trade road linking [[The Stone Lands]] to [[The Waste]].  As it grew, [[House Greenwood]] was compelled to install a governor of the territory - raising [[House Crayclaw]] to noble status.  The roads are all dirt, and the buildings are all one story and roofed with straw with the exception of [[Stormhammer's Spire]].

!Social Customs
* Being a trading town, there are many transient folks visiting the city.  It is illegal to carry bladed weapons or strung bows in the city.  Weapons may be checked into the armory and bows must be unstrung.

!Notable Characters and Groups
| [img[images/characters/Notable People/The Dales/Oxam/brennen-crayclaw-portrait.jpg][Brennen Crayclaw]] &lt;br&gt;[[Brennen Crayclaw]] |__[[Brennen Crayclaw]]__ is the Lord [[Shield]] of Oxam.  He is [[Bannerman]] to [[House Greenwood]].  He takes little interest in the daily management of the city, instead enjoying the rewards of his nobility.  He is sly and crafty, wishing above all to curry favor with [[House Greenwood]] and raise in station upon the death of his liege.  He is very aware of [[The Family]], and does nothing to stop them as long as they continue to provide him with a portion of their earnings.  |
| [img[images/characters/Notable People/The Dales/Oxam/darius-kabald-portrait.jpg][Darius Kabald]] &lt;br&gt; [[Darius Kabald]] |__[[Darius Kabald]]__ is a [[Darkling]] [[Cloak]] who heads the [[Darkling Gang]] known as [[The Family]].  He is ruthless, greedy and cunning.  Known as &quot;The Barber&quot; for his keen use of a blade, he has since earning the name setup a barber shop in the darker side of the city.  Since taking over [[The Family]] by openly challenging and killing the former leader, [[Darius Kabald]] has taken the group down much more sinister paths.  Working with [[Magnus Zizorum]] they distributed a custom drug known as [[Ghoul Rot]] - made from undead flesh. |
| [img[images/characters/Notable People/The Dales/Oxam/hrothbane-stormhammer-portrait.jpg][Hrothbane Stormhammer]] &lt;br&gt; [[Hrothbane Stormhammer]] |__[[Hrothbane Stormhammer]]__ is a [[Kombar'Ran]] wizard that secludes himself in his tower within the city.  He is always deep in study and experimentation, where he has begun to master the lost art of crafting [[Golems|Golem]].  While he has had success in animating rock and wood, his current goal is to make a [[Golem]] of iron.|

!Places Of Interest
* [[The Taphouse]] is a low-class inn near the west gate.  It is frequented by thugs and low-lifes.
* [[Old Town Barber]] is a barber shop owned by [[Darius Kabald]] and where he conducts business for [[The Family]]
* [[Stormhammer's Spire]] is the only building in town with a slate roof, and home to [[Hrothbane Stormhammer]].  It has no windows or doors on the first level, and can only be entered by magically moving the stone inside of the door frame.</pre>

!Description
Palm Flora is a city on the continent of [[Amon]] found within the [[Polité Of Bronze]].  It is a large and prosperous independent port city, perhaps the most influential merchant city along [[The Risen Reef]].  From their high perches in the [[Upper City|Palma Flora Upper City]], the local nobles (known as [[Patriars|Patriar]]) gaze down with veiled contempt upon the common rabble in the grimy [[Lower City|Palma Flora Lower City]] which hugs the foggy harbor.

The whole of Palma Flora reeks of blood, crime and opportunity.  One can easily fathom why pirates and traders are drawn to this place like flies to a carcass.  The [[Patriars|Patriar]] pay a mercenary army called [[The Keepers]] to protect their interests in the city, and by extension, the city itself.  The [[Patriars|Patriar]] elect five among them as a governing body, known as [[Princeps]].  The [[Patriars|Patriar]] here have become increasingly out of touch with the common folk, and are generally have a reputation of callousness.  The common folk hold the [[Patriar]] in contempt, as they are out of touch with everyday life and value citizens' lives so cheaply.

The city is built on the rocky shore with poor soil, but boasts the best bay on the coast.  It receives frequent mist and drizzle, causing fog to hang in the harbor and across the [[Lower City|Palma Flora Lower City]].  The city boasts an advances sewer and drainage system to remove all of the excess water, and direct it towards a massive cistern within [[The Temple District|Palma Flora Temple District]].  Despite this feat of engineering, the cellars here are often damp and the smell of mildew is common.

Those that live here are very tolerant of races and religions, to the point of ambivalence.  Anyone wishing to make a coin is welcome to call Palma Flora home, and the city tends to collect misfits.

Palma Flora is perfectly situated on the coast to be a commercial hub.  Craftspeople, merchants, traders, and smugglers all make a brisk living in the city, and many immigrants are drawn to the dream that anyone willing to work hard can be successful here.

!Social Customs
[[The Carnival Of Coin]] is celebrated each Spring, a time where more of the large merchant ships from across [[Asha]] find themselves in port unloading their goods.  There are games, festivities, and many good deals in the makeshift stalls setup across the city.

!Adventure Hooks
''Rob From The Rich'' - Arriving just in time for a semiannual bazaar known as [[The Carnival Of Coin]], the characters begin to notice a strange trance like state that temporarily overtakes a number of wealthy merchants who then sell off their most expensive wares for next to nothing.  These merchants hire the characters to find the source of this enchantment, which turns out to be a wandering band of charlatans who seek to redistribute wealth to the poor.  The characters must decide whether they wish to turn in these thieves for rewards from the merchants, or let them go and risk becoming hunted alongside them.
''The Tower's Secrets'' - The young mage who recently came under the ownership of [[The Tower Of Unadarin]] is woefully unprepared for the task of opening the upper floors of the tower.  Filled with traps and dangers from the previous owner, he seeks able bodied adventurers who are willing to place themselves at risk to help him fully unlock his new home.

Many children, both rich and poor, look forward to this holiday for the customary treats and gifts traditionally given.  It is customary for families to sacrifice a prize animal from their herd, honoring the sacrifice [[Xander]] had made for [[Asha]].

Some Patriars are economically-minded individuals who rise early and spend their days in meetings and negotiations.  They fund expeditions into dangerous locales and hire explorers to map uncharted territories.  Other Patriars manipulate their region's power players through diplomacy and intrigue.

The reality that Pelquin was built upon [[Elvish ruins|The Sylvan Empire]] is unknown to many of its inhabitants.

!Social Customs
*The spicing of food is common in Pelquin.  The abundance of the [[Pimenta]] plant in this region allows for easy access to spices for cooking.

!Notable Characters
*[[Jendar Gibbins]] is the only known [[Darkling]] to ever hold elected office.  He serves as the [[Reeve]] for the city, in service to [[House Eulien]].  Most of the common folk however are just fine with his leadership and are thankful for the strong armed presence with his appointed guardsman, despite their unsavory nature.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Athenaeum/penelope-kensington/penelope-kensington.jpg]]
Penelope Kensington (c. 980 [[AAP]] to Current) is a witch who teaches [[Divination]] at [[The Athenaeum]]. She is rarely surprised, but when she is she is incredibly delighted. She has bright red hair and enjoys wearing the color green. She is good friends with [[Nester Arkwood]], who consults with her and her talents on matters of great import.

Penelope was born to [[House Kensington]], a noble [[Minor House|Houses Of The Viridian Empire]] aligned to [[House Vaisanan]].  As a child, she was taught by her father the skill of [[Divination]].  She took to it naturally, and unlike her father was prone to rare premonitions that would predict great events.  These would come on suddenly like an affliction, with great pain and force - luckily they did not happen often.  Her first was as a young teen, where she knew that if she did not leave her family that they would be doomed.  Without informing her father, she ran off with a circus named [[Hooper's Dreamland]] and began telling fortunes to commoners.  This circus was a front for a criminal enterprise that pick pocketed noble audience members - and Penelope embraced this new lifestyle.  She connected with the idea of common folk getting their just due from nobles.  Here her powers grew through practice, and she picked up skills like [[Thieves' Cant]].  She left the circus when they began asking more from her, and wanting her to use her powers against the common folk.

Her travels brought her to the city of [[Zylok]], where she set up shop in [[The Docks]] selling fortunes to those most in need.  Again, her affliction took hold and she felt a great disturbance in [[The Eternal Cycle]] centered around [[The Athenaeum]].  At great haste, she sought out [[Headmaster]] [[Nester Arkwood]] to inform him of her concern.  To her surprise, [[Nester Arkwood]] was very aware of the schism in [[The Eternal Cycle]] caused by [[The Chrono Ocullum]] and was actively attempting to free [[The Grey Companions]] from a time loop.  She was able to confer with [[Nester Arkwood]] and assist in brainstorming methods to solve the time paradox.  He was so impressed that he hired her as a [[Professor]] at [[The Athenaeum]] on the spot.

At [[The Athenaeum]], she excelled.  She quickly found herself at home, with other people of power like her.  One person in particular stood out to Penelope.  [[Artimas Meliger]] became an object of affection for her, and she actively flirts with him yet he is oblivious.

In 1025 [[AAP]], she revealed herself to be a member of [[The Remnant]], attacking and killing [[Nester Arkwood]] in order to retrieve [[The Shard Of Sakkrad]] and bring about the resurrection of [[The Whispered One]] in an event known as [[The Black Night]].

Perhaps the chief misconception about the pimenta plant is its red-hot reputation.  The fact of the matter is that the elongated peppers often are fiery-hot, but many others are sweet, mild, or richly flavored.

The pepper grows local to the northeastern region near [[Pelquin]].  Locals have adopted the plant for culinary uses, falling in love with the spicy taste.  The seeds of the pimenta are the main source of the pepper’s heat.  The seeds can be removed, dried and grounded to form a potent powder that can easily be stored and applied to food as needed.

Younger peppers may also be harvested and ground to form a paste or sauce, which is often flavored with other vegetables to add flavor and texture.</pre>

Before a Priest can offer his services to a desired church, he must perform at least 2 years of missionary work.  This is to enhance the wisdom and of the Priest, as well as to help spread the word of [[The Gods]].

When becoming a Priest, an [[Acolyte]] severs any political or family ties by striping away their house/family name.  They only recognize their first name.

Proculus Vindex (958 [[AAP]] - Current) is the [[Tribune]] of [[Sirmium]], [[The Elder Of Bronze]], [[The Grand Lotus]].  Author of &quot;[[Moral Being]]&quot;, and master orator of [[Amon]].

Historian, lawyer, and scholar, he plays an important role among the other [[Tribunes|Tribune]] by offering wise and thoughtful council.  Proculus is a prolific writer, and has extensive writings on many topics, most notable on Ethics, Morals, and Philosophy.  He is considered one of [[Amon's|Amon]] greatest authors and orators.  A new renaissance of thought was inspired by his teachings, as he believes [[Human]] ingenuity is the most powerful force on [[Asha]].

He is beloved by the citizens of his [[Polité]], for he is known to be a man of the people.  Setting aside his position, he frequently meets with the lowliest of people; for he says they are the greatest in need.  Proculus believes he is a servant of the people, rather than their ruler.

Proculus appreciates the balance in the world.  He teaches that all are equal, and that your birthplace does not define you; and you can create your own destiny.  It is [[The Gods]] that grant one purpose, not the government.  Because of this thinking, the [[Patriars|Patriar]] dislike him; this causes challenges for him as they are wealthy and influential across his [[Polité]].</pre>

[[Elves|Elf]], [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], [[Gnomes|Gafflinz]], [[Orcs|Orc]] and [[Trolls|Troll]] are very rarely encountered in the civilized parts of the world.  It should be known that the [[Elves|Elf]] are classified as two sub-races: the [[Forana'loloKashira]] and the [[Variona'Sha]].  The [[Forana'loloKashira]] are deeply secured and hidden within their sacred forests, and have no contact with the other races.  While it is true that a small handful of [[Forana'loloKashira]] are found outside of their forests, they are considered eccentric and some have lost the ability to return to their forest homes.  These are often the youngest of the race, who have no memories of [[The Third Age]].

[[Humans|Human]] have contact with the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] and [[Variona'Sha]], and all have very good relations.  The [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] and [[Humans|Human]] have very lucrative trading pacts and the [[Variona'Sha]] are known to trade regularly with the cities close to their borders.  However it is not rare to find an [[Elf]] or [[Dwarf]] in a [[Human]] city.

The [[Gafflinz]] (or Gnomes) are a very strange race that has a higher technology level then the rest of the world.  All cultures have legends of encounters with the [[Gafflinz]], describing them as curious and eccentric - however little to no contact with a [[Gafflinz]] has been had in centuries, and they are but legends to many [[Humans|Human]].

The [[Human]] cities that currently occupy [[Asha]] are often built on the ashes of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  Because of this [[Elven ruins|The Sylvan Empire]] are not uncommon in everyday travels.  It is possible to stumble upon a lost and forgotten [[Elven|Elf]] temple that has not been explored since the great [[Elves|Elf]] themselves fled from it.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Notable People/Amon/rafail-kallides.jpg]]

Rafail Kallides (977 [[AAP]] - Current) has the title of [[The Salt King]].  He leads the pirate organization known as [[The Mummers]] in [[The Risen Reef]] off of the coast of [[Amon]].  He rules with an iron fist, and is known for being both charismatic and overly brutal to those who wrong him or [[The Mummers]].  His ship, [[The Bone Heart]], strikes fear in those that see it due to being adorned with the bones of his enemies and being able to spit fire from its bow.

Rafail gained the moniker of &quot;The Worm&quot; when he trapped the notorious pirate hunter [[Myrto Stamiade]] in [[The Deadman's Reef]], causing her and her crew to succumb to the petrification effects of a clutch of [[Lindworms|Lindworm]].

Rafail was a long standing and renowned pirate of [[The Mummers]] prior to rising to the title of [[The Salt King]] in 1010 [[AAP]].

!Learning Of The Dark Arts
Through mysterious circumstances, Rafail studies [[Blood Magic]] to suit his own ends, gaining a level of mastery of some incantations.  It is unknown what he had to endure to gain this knowledge, but legends have said that he learned from an ancient tome he uncovered in his piracy.  He gained the power to resurrect those he killed through rituals, and was fascinated with gaining supernatural power.  Rafail is obsessed with [[Magic]], and has dabbled with [[Blood Magic]] for decades to provide him a supernatural edge.  He is too impatient to study [[Wizardry]], was not gifted with [[Sorcery]], and is too independent to submit to [[Occultism]] or [[Divine Favor]].  He wields [[The Sabre Of The Seas]], a sword embedded with a ruby that holds the soul of a [[Sorcerer|Sorcery]] that he killed that grants him the power over elements.  When Rafail bested the previous [[Salt King|The Salt King]], [[Caxton Loom]], he raised him as a [[Zombie]] beholden to him; now an enforcer of Rafail's will.

!The Blockade Of Palalia
Rafail's chief claim to fame was the blockade of the port of [[Palalia]], a trading hub of [[The Saffron Isles]].  In 1005 [[AAP]], under the direction of the current [[Salt King|The Salt King]] [[Garrad Stroud]], Rafail lead the blockaded of the port with a small squadron of 4 vessels.  He plundered 5 heavily laden merchant ships attempting to enter or leave port.  No ships could transit the port for fear of being harried by the pirate flotilla.  Among one of the captured ships were a handful of [[Amoni]] nobles, who Rafail kept as prisoner and held ransom in exchange for the unusual demand of a chestful of alchemist supplies and medicines.  The bargaining took days, but was successful.  The nobles were returned unharmed, but without clothing as an embarrassment to their station.

He warned of [[The Third Desecration]], but not everyone listened.  Those that did fled the cities of [[The Sylvan Empire]] to become the [[Forana'loloKashira]].  Much of the events of his life were lost to history, and only fragments of the story survive.

[[Zezebazum]] tempted him to become the final and most powerful [[Kiraga]], but Raime refused - stalling the events of [[The Third Desecration]].  It is not known if Raime survived the exodus of the cities.</pre>

In order to establish a standard currency in his kingdom, [[Tarmon Gellius]] began to mint Red Queens nearly 3000 years ago.  The queens are minted from silver, and dyed a bright red.  Their name was thought of by the King himself, who wished for his beautiful wife to be immortalized on the face of his [[Currency]].  The tradition of emblazoning the coin's face with a prominent woman survived through [[The Old Republic]] and into modern times.

<pre>Once you were an obedient member of a religious cult.  You may have been a follower of a [[Azarad-Ji]], [[Dathairä]], twisted [[Fey]] or just a power-hungry religious fanatic - that is of little importance now.  What matters now is that, somehow, you found it in you to free yourself from the blind servitude and saw the error of your ways.  Many innocents died by your hand - sacrificed on an alter or slain in raids.  Brainwashed, drugged, or simply confused and misled you have committed crimes so heinous you could hardly ever ask for forgiveness.  Nevertheless, you have left the cult determined to seek a new life.  Will it be a life of virtue in a pursuit of redemption or a lonesome journey of an embittered and broken individual trying to run away from their past?  Why did you join the cult in the first place?  What made you see through the veil of the cult indoctrination?  How have you managed to escape?

!Feature: The Black Sheep
Thanks to your long affiliation with a cult community, you can very easily identify anyone who is a member of a commune similar to your own.  All cults are essentially the same and their members exhibit the same behavioral patterns.  By extension, you can also easily recognize any drug addicts, compulsive liars and people with various behavioral disorders.  Additionally (this is up to you and your DM to decide), some of your former brothers and sisters in faith might not know you have defected and would be willing to provide you (and only you) with shelter and supplies.  However, the question is whether you want to stay with them again.

!Suggested Characteristics
* My past still haunts me in my dreams.  I often wake up screaming or do not sleep at all.
* I anger quickly and I am prone to violent tantrums when someone tries to control me or give me orders.
* Being a pawn in someone else's game left me with an inability to make choices on my own.  I am indecisive.
* I trance out and lose touch with reality.  I am sometimes delusional or experience delirious states.
* Boundaries were violated time and time again in the cult until I lost sense of which boundaries were appropriate. I often behave inappropriately or in a seemingly random manner.
* Constant feelings of shame, helplessness and inferiority make me change my mood at a moment’s notice. I suffer from mood swings or sudden emotional breakdowns.
* I feel immense guilt over my past actions and welcome suffering as my atonement. I have little or no regard for my personal health.
* Every day I expect to get a knife in my gut and I see vengeful assassins in every shadow. I am paranoid or suspicious of others.

!Ideal
* Protective. Dark cults trifle with powers that are beyond their understanding or control. Those fools must be stopped. (lawful)
* Nihilist. What’s the point of anything? People are insignificant and their struggle is futile. (neutral)
* Repentant. I cannot possibly undo the wrongs I have done, but I can still try and atone. (good)
* Anarchist. Lives of men should not be ruled by anyone. No gods, no masters! (chaotic)
* Denial. It wasn’t me. I wasn’t myself! (any)
* Selfish. The world is doomed either way. Better make to most of it. (evil)

!Bond
* When I left the cult, I took one of its relics with me. For some strange reason, I cannot part with it.
* They were supposed to be sacrificed, I have helped them escape. Now I feel responsible for them.
* It breaks my heart to know that my close friend, lover or family member is still a loyal follower of the cult.
* The cult leader made me kill my old friend during the initiation. I have not forgotten that and I want revenge.
* I cannot stand by and watch as more children and youths get turned into mindless fanatics or are exploited for someone else's personal gain.
* No one must ever know about my involvement with the cult.

!Flaw
* Sometimes, I hear voices in my head that command me to do terrible things. And sometimes, I give in.
* I am having second thoughts about my leaving the cult. I am afraid I could easily return to my old ways given the right circumstance.
* I take great solace in flagellation. The road to salvation leads through blood and self-inflicted pain.
* Before I left, I was given a task (by the dark lord or deity, or the cult leader) that I am yet to fulfill.
* In the cult, they fed us drugs. I am still heavily addicted and I will do anything to get a dose.
* I dread the idea of killing another sentient creature, I have already spilled enough blood. 

!Notable Cults
* __[[The Penitentine Sect]]__ is a small group of outlaws that fight militantly against [[Magic]].  Led by a religious zealot called [[Pious John]], they believe [[Magic]] is unholy and must be scourged from [[Asha]].
* __[[The Chosen]]__ are a loose collection of worshipers of [[Azarad-Ji]], said to be led by [[Azarad-Ji]] himself - despite him being locked away in an inescapable prison.</pre>

}}}
Death is an essential part of [[The Eternal Cycle]], yet there remain those that were taken before their time.  Some magic grants the power to pull souls back into a mortal coil, granting a chance to live again.  Those that have died and come back may be changed by the ordeal, depending on the duration their soul remained in the after-life.

If a creature is dead, and a resurrection is attempted by magical means by a spell with a casting time longer than a single action, a ''Resurrection Challenge'' is initiated.  Up to 3 individuals can offer to contribute to the ritual via a Contribution Skill Check.  The DM asks them each to make a skill check based on their form of contribution, with the DC of the check adjusting to how helpful/impactful the DM feels the contribution would be.  For example, praying to the god of the devout, fallen character may require an Intelligence (Religion) check at an easy to medium difficulty, where loudly demanding the soul of the fallen to return from the aether may require a Charisma (Intimidation) check at a very hard or nearly impossible difficulty.  Advantage and disadvantage can apply here based on how perfect, or off base the contribution offered is.

After all contributions are completed, the DM then rolls a single, final Resurrection success check with no modifier.  The base DC for the final resurrection check is ''10'', increasing ''1'' for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone (signifying the slow erosion of the soul's connection to this world).  For each successful contribution skill check, this DC is decreased by ''3'', whereas each failed contribution skill check increases the DC by ''1''.  Upon a successful resurrection check, the creature's soul (should it be willing) will be returned to the body, and the ritual succeeded.  On a failed check, the soul does not return and the character is lost.

Only the strongest of magical incantations can bypass this resurrection challenge, in the form of the True Resurrection or Wish spells.  These spells can also restore a character to life who was lost due to a failed resurrection ritual.

If a spell with a casting time of 1 action is used to attempt to restore life (via the Rivivify spell or similar effects), no contribution skill checks are allowed.  The character casting the spell makes a Rapid Resurrection check, rolling a d20 and adding their spellcasting ability modifier.  The DC is 10, increasing by 1 for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone.  On a failure, the character's soul is not lost, but the resurrection fails and increases any future Resurrection checks DC by 1.  No further attempts can be made to restore this character to life until a resurrection spell with a casting time higher than 1 action is attempted.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/bestiary/ruthie.jpg]]
Many fisherman tell tales of seeing a creature within [[Lake Acharutha]].  They tell of a large serpentine head, and sharp jagged teeth that can rend an unsuspecting ship in two.  This monster they have affectionately named ‘Ruthie’.  Ruthie spans 20-100 feet in length, depending on the story you listen to.  She also can be quite friendly, or ferocious.  Those fishermen who have been mysteriously lost in the lake have been said to be eaten by Ruthie.

The truth behind the stories is that there are in fact creatures living in the shadowy depths of [[Lake Acharutha]].  There are a few groups of these long necked reptiles who have been living in the lake long before the [[Human|Human]] arrived.  They thrive on the abundant fish that live in the lake.  Ocassionally, one of these monsters may be seen rising to the surface for a breath of air, but they are shy, staying away from the fisherman.  The creatures also find the fisherman’s presence helpful, often dining on the fish caught within their nets.  When the mist forms on the lake, the creatures can sometimes be heard forming long low sounding hums and grumbles.  This only adds to the fear of Ruthie and the lake.</pre>

Salix Daelof (c. 974 [[AAP]] to Current) is the loud and boisterous keeper of animals at [[The Athenaeum]].  He is a tough as nails [[Dwarf]], and the keeper of [[The Menagerie]]. He is excellent with the care of exotic animals. He will speak of anything other than the means by which he lost his eye. He is good friends with [[Artimas Meliger]], as the two of them studied together as young boys in [[The Athenaeum]].

Although he does not have favorite animals, he has two that have strong bonds with him.  The first is a [[Blink Dog]] named [[Julius]], and the second is a [[Mimic]] named [[Chester]].  He has trained [[Chester]] to accept food from out of his hand, which is a enormous feat considering the predatory nature of [[Mimics|Mimic]].  As a special gift, [[Nester Arkwood]] enchanted a leash for [[Julius]] that prevents him from blinking, and therefore limits the amount of trouble he can get into.

He excels at training animals of all varieties and types, however there is only one animal type that he refuses to tame - felines.  He never explains why, but it is clear he has some strong emotion related to the subject - and even seems uneasy around the beasts no matter their size or temperament.

He is greatly respected, having expanding his vast fortune from what was once two worn-out ships. Now he owns a network of fast, reliable ships, riders and caravans.

Santino is the keeper of house for [[The Grey Companions]].  He is accountable to seeing to the needs of the staff, and administration and upkeep of the house.  He is an older gentleman, accustomed to serving nobility and comfortable around them.  He is literate, charismatic, and a known pacifist. 

Santino's posture is excellent, always standing straight and rigid, carrying himself like a true gentleman.  In his youth, Santino was classically trained on the [[Lyre]] by the traveling bard [[Duncan Littletoes]], a famous [[Bairn]] who rose to become the court musician for [[House Anwyn]].  Santino is known to be very cautious, and worries unduly about many things.  He worries when he is too far from his wife [[Gretchen Jamarion]], or if items under his care are at risk of damage.  He is generous, kind and friendly.  He is always smiling to a fault, even if he is worried, sick or afraid.

His prized possession is a [[Lyre]] given to him by his mentor [[Duncan Littletoes]].  The [[Lyre]] was the same instrument [[Duncan Littletoes]] played in front of the [[Emperor]] [[Jayce Jedaleon II]].

Santino and his wife [[Gretchen Jamarion]] served [[Lord]] [[Nolan Roth]], last of [[House Roth]] for 30 years before [[Nolan Roth]] passed away.  This not only left them devastated that their good friend was gone, but also without a [[Lord]] to care for.  [[Nolan Roth]] before passing made plans to ensure Santino, his wife, and all of his staff were cared for.  To start they inherited some of the meager treasury of [[House Roth]], enough to live a comfortable life.  Second, [[Nolan Roth]] contacted everyone he knew to provide strong recommendations for all of his staff to ensure they would have a new house to serve.  It was this act that brought Santino and his wife to [[The Grey Companions]], as [[Asavir Gallowglass]] provided the reference that brought them together.</pre>

<pre>The Sashes are the highest ranking military contingent of [[The Waste]], primarily found within the capital city of [[Akabele-ethu]].  Similar to a [[Knight]], the Sashes are an [[Uskardeen]] tradition of service to one's [[Lord]].  Whereas a [[Knight]] is refered to as &quot;Ser&quot;, a Sash is customarily referred to as татко, meaning &quot;master&quot;.  They are respected as tough fighters, due to their unique fighting style [[Borbata]].

!Advantages &amp; Disadvantages
A Sash has Legal Enforcement Powers (10 points), Duty [always on duty, 15 or less] (-15 points), Combat Reflexes (15 points), Military Rank (variable), Reputation +2 from citizens, and guardsmen from other cities (5 points).
It costs 15 points to play a Sash.

!Military Rank
0 White Sash, 1 Red Sash, 2 Blue Sash, 3 Copper Sash, 4 Silver Sash, 5 Gold Sash, 6 Lord General

!Patrols
There are 1000 Sashes, in which [[House Tuul]] is in complete control over.  The city watch patrols in groups of 4 men armed with leather armor, batons and short swords.  Their instructions are to arrest and bring into custody any wrongdoers.  Sashes may enter buildings and perform searches at will.  Patrolmen will first attempt to have the arrested person come peacefully, but if this is impossible they will fight.  Sashes are trained to first attempt to grapple or disarm, then subdue.  Killing blows will be used only if one of the watch is seriously wounded, or a dangerous weapon is brandished.  The gate and wall guardsmen wear scale mail, long swords and halberds or spears.  There is always an officer on duty.  The gate guards are known to be a little more dour than patrolmen, and are formidable fighters.

!Law
Weapons may not be worn concealed in the city, and laws exist against brandishing or undue violence.  Any weapon that is worn must be peace bonded to the sheath (tied with a string), bows must be unstrung.  The city closes at nightfall, and curfew is strictly enforced 1 hour later within city walls.  There are 2 levels to the legal system.  The lower level consists of 25 town magistrates (known as [[White Robes]]) who have the authority to place immediate judgement on serious or less important crimes.  A magistrate can always be summoned in 30 minutes to place judgement (which may be appealed and tried before the [[Akabele-ethu Lord’s Court]] within 2 days).  Only registered citizens can appeal, although non-citizens may have a citizen appeal on their behalf.  Prisoners awaiting trial or serving their sentences are kept within the cells beneath the palace.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/bestiary/famous/sathric.jpg]]

Sathric is a [[Shadow Dragon]] born in [[The Shadow Lands]] and now living with [[The Grey Companions]] on [[The Material Plane]].  As far as [[Dragons|Dragon]] go, he is a youngling at only 20 years of age.  His mentor was [[Hirador]], an ancient [[Shadow Dragon]] who flew away into the darkness once Sathric was of age to care for himself.  A rift to [[The Material Plane]] was created by [[Magnus Zizorum]], allowing a group of [[Barguul]] to exit and begin to take over [[House Saxon]].  Upon seeing this doorway, Sathric jumped through behind the [[Barguul]], recalling from his racial memory the beauty of [[The Material Plane]].  He met [[The Grey Companions]] as they were defeating the [[Barguul]], and assisted them in their mission.  [[Desini Orosco]], [[Erik Doorhaus]], and [[Minerva Carrington]] took a liking to Sathric and allowed him to stay in the manor despite them knowing of who he really was.

He often takes the form of a bald [[Uskardeen]] male, powerfully built.  His voice remains deep, like that of his true form.  Sathric is very curious about the world, and seeks to understand [[Human]] nature.  He has brief glimpses of past experiences in his mind due to his racial memory - yet he wants to experience the thrill of the world first hand.  Being young, he still has quite a bit to learn - and can appear oblivious or absent minded to simple things.  While he has the body of a man, you can think of his mind more as that of a child.

His racial memory grants him visions of experiences lived by his ancestors.  He has been surprised to find he is an excellent dancer, and skilled at meteorology - despite never having tried those skills in [[The Shadow Lands]].

Sathric, like many [[Dragons|Dragon]] is insatiably curious.  As a member of [[The Grey Companions]], he prefers to stay home and read the books within the manor's library rather than go on adventures.  He spends much of his free time with his nose in a book, or sleeping, but does also enjoy speaking with the staff in the manor house.  His favorite person to speak with is [[Santino Jamarion]], for he respects him as an elder - and is constantly asking questions about the minor aspects of life.  The two of them get on very well together, and seem to enjoy their conversations.

[[The Grey Companions]] have been good to Sathric, and treated him fairly despite the fact he was a [[Dragon]].  They even offered for him to join [[The Grey Companions]], however he did not feel himself worthy.  He owes them a great debt however, and is fiercely loyal to them.

His mentor [[Hirador]] raised Sathric in [[The Shadow Lands]].  As an ancient [[Dragon]], [[Hirador]] was cruel and callous.  He raised Sathric to be a predator - and feed upon those that weaker (which is everything).  Together, they pillaged the local area - feeding on any life they encountered.  The two [[Dragons|Dragon]] were feared within [[The Shadow Lands]], and even at a young age Sathric was able to take down [[Barguul]] and devour them.  When [[Hirador]] left, Sathric was alone to fend for himself.  When Sathric saw the portal to [[The Material Plane]], his racial memory suddenly flooded with experiences of past lives outside of [[The Shadow Lands]].  He was filled with regret at the horror of his life up until this point - and jumped through with the plans to begin life anew, to live a good life.</pre>

Scathe have tough leathery skin, like a snake.  Reptilian in nature, their yellow eyes sense heat and have excellent [[Infravision]] good to a range of 120'.  Scathe are noted to be muted green or brown in color, and just as often milky-white.  Scathe are tribal, and possess rudimentary culture.  It is not quite clear on their level of intelligence.  They scavenge from other races, and have been known to brandish weapons they have acquired during raids.  Considered a nuisance by all other races.

Their communication is rudimentary, consisting of basic howls, grunts and shrieks.  They form into packs which are led by the strongest among them.

Scathe larvae are small worm like creatures with mottled brown skin.  They have a well developed beak when they hatch.  Maturing larvae will have limbs visible under their skin, which they shed when it is outgrown.

Professor at [[The Athenaeum]] who teaches [[Metamagic]] and [[Teleportation]] to upper and lower school students.  He never appears happy, is a killjoy and always depressed.  His serious demeanor has him always focused on study, and he strongly disproves of when others prioritize merriment over work.

He has high expectations of his students, and demands they act and contribute with excellence and determination.  He has a motto &quot;Work Is Our Joy, Long Live Labor&quot; and when he quotes it is the only time he is known to have a visible smile.  He is studious, and known across [[Asha]] for his research in [[Metamagic]].

As a student in [[The Athenaeum]], he excelled at his study and was regarded as one of the best.  He reveled in learning, and poured himself into his work such that he had little to no friends among the other students.  Despite his efforts and the knowledge he gained, he was forever overshadowed by a fellow student named [[Sanders]] - who for reasons unknown to Seipher Black was [[Nester Arkwood's|Nester Arkwood]] favorite.

Known to the [[Elves|Elf]] as Sene'Rine'Rada, the world of dreams.  This dimension is a reflection of the natural world, and everything that happens here to a dreamer is real.  If a person dies in Sene'Rine'Rada, their body dies in the real world.  Along those same lines, people who are wounded here will awaken with the wounds.

The world is malleable; one can project thoughts and create creatures and buildings.  Use the [[Lucid Dreaming Skill]] to manipulate the world of dreams.  There is always a soft glowing ambient light everywhere, with no apparent source.  One often experiences a constant feeling of unseen eyes watching from every direction while within it.  Time also passes at a different rate, sometimes slow and other times faster than the real world.

Dreamers do not enter Sene'Rine'Rada without the use of the [[Dream Walking Spell|Communication &amp; Empathy]], except in rare occasions.  It is possible for an unskilled dreamer to inadvertently find themselves here only for a few seconds before they flicker back to their own dream.</pre>

Shadow dragons are [[true dragons|Dragon]] that were either born in [[The Shadow Lands]] or transformed by years spent within its dismal confines.  Some shadow dragons embrace [[The Shadow Lands]] for its bleak landscapes and desolation, while others desperately seek to return to [[The Material Plane]].

The transformation to a shadow dragon happens over a period of years, during which time a dragon's scales lose their luster and fade into a charcoal hue.  Its leathery wings become translucent, its eyes paling to pools of opalescent gray.  Shadow dragons find sunlight abhorrent, and they are weaker in bright light than they are in darkness.  Darkness makes the dragon fade to a spectral shadow of its former self.  A shadow dragon is so suffused with the power of [[The Shadow Lands]] that even a return to [[The Material Plane]] can't undo its transformation.  Some shadow dragons attempt to lure other creatures from the mortal realm back to [[The Shadow Lands]] to keep them company, at least until they tire of their guests and devour them.  Others are happy to leave [[The Shadow Lands]] behind forever, understanding that treasure and power are easier to come by in [[The Material Plane]].

It is far within the frontier of [[The Orcish Lands]]; occupied solely by a garrison and those brave enough to withstand living in a barren wasteland to serve the needs of the soldiers stationed here.

The outpost does not have the amenities of a city, and only has a makeshift [[Teleportation Circle]] made of old wood and paint, dusty streets of packed grey dirt, and ramshackle buildings.

A short hike to the east is [[The Boneyard]], an anti-magic zone that attracts all sorts of dangers.

In truth, the name Shadow Holde was originally the nickname given to the ruins of a [[forgotten hall|Shadow Holde Hall]] dating back to [[The Second Age]].

Shalekasha (The Astral Soul, Mother Of Vengance, Queen of [[The Bronze Citadel]]) is an [[AstraKashira]] that came to the aid of the [[Draugaira]] [[Elves|Elf]] in [[The Third Age]] to slay [[The Whispered One]].  She is now an [[Archdevil]] that rules over [[The Circle Of Pride|Avernus]] in [[Baator]].  Her fall from grace was a tragic one, in which she was slain and corrupted by [[The Whispered One]].  Upon his death, her soul was captured by [[Zezebazum]] in [[Baator]].  To her surprise, she awoke not to an army of [[Dathairä]], but to the promise of a job offer to lead [[Baator]] in a campaign to rid [[Asha]] of [[Blood Magic]].

She is obsessed with stamping out the [[Human]] impulse that gave rise to [[The Whispered One]], and sees herself as using the forces of [[Baator]] to achieve a just and righteous outcome.  She is blinded by zealous fury as much as she is her own pride.  She is reckless and rash is combat, fighting with a fury and resolve that makes her a dangerous combatant.  Off the battlefield, she has grown to exhibit the same reckless and rash personality, and has grown cruel and callous in her time as the ruler of [[Avernus]].  She is notorious for her foul temper and poor emotional control which impedes her ability to act rationally and pragmatically.  She refuses to play politics, and prefers to charge headfirst into dangerous situations.

[[Zezebazum]] knew her corruption would be a boon to his master, [[Azarad-Ji]].  Her position in [[Baator]] is one of his most crowning achievements.  He was able to abuse her fatal flaw: hubris.  [[AstraKashira]] had a sense of infallibility about their actions, and her anger was only further inflamed by the righteousness with which she acted.  [[Zezebazum]] praised her for her strength of convictions, but it was her unbridled rage that had cemented her downfall.  She had become so zealously hell-bent on preventing another rise of [[The Whispered One]] that she was willing to abandon her principles and sacrifice the very innocent lives she had once sworn to protect in order to achieve her goal.

Two [[Draugaira]] [[Paladins|Paladin]] named [[Haurumana]] and [[Olanthiosa]] were stalwart companions of Shalekasha in her fight against [[The Whispered One]].  [[Haurumana]] reluctantly corrupted himself, following loyally in the service of Shalekasha despite reluctance of their path.  [[Olanthiosa]], seeing the corruption chose instead to throw himself on his blade; but was resurrected by Shalekasha to serve her in undeath.</pre>

This attack consists of a swift advance to close the distance with the enemy, ending with a thrusting attack with a dagger or knife.  An attack in this maneuver allows the attacker to move one //extra// hex with his Step and Attack maneuver, and do +1 damage.  This bonus applies to thrusting attacks only.  The swift advance leaves the attacker open to counterattacks, granting them -3 on active defense rolls.

''Dringa or &quot;Reply&quot; in [[Elvish]]''
This maneuver is a quick counter-attack after successfully parrying an enemy attack.  It can only be employed with thrusting weapons and hand attacks.  The character can choose to use this maneuver if he has been successfully attacked by a melee attack.  He must Parry the attack; if successful, he can instantly attack (or Feint) at -4.  The enemy is at -1 to defend (he is still recovering from the attack), and at an additional -1 for every point by which the Parry was successful (do not count Passive Defense bonuses).

''Rhassa or &quot;Whirlwind&quot; in [[Elvish]]''
This maneuver consists of a quick pivot of the body resulting in a spinning attack with a weapon.  The intended result of the sudden shift in the attack's center of gravity is to surprise the enemy, but an experienced martial artist is not likely to be fooled by it.
The maneuver allows a simultaneous Feint and attack.  The attacker must roll twice.  First, roll a Quick Contest of Rhassa vs the opponent's weapon skill (or Brawling, Karate, DX if unarmed).  Then roll a second time to deliver the attack.  If the Feint was successful, use the Feinting rules on p. B96 to determine the enemy's defense penalties.  However, if the defender wins the contest, he gets a //bonus// equal to the amount by which he won the contest;  the attack was badly delivered and the attacker &quot;telegraphed&quot; the attack, making it easier to defend.

''Dual Weapon Attack (Hard)''
The attacker may strike with two weapons //at once//, at the same foe or two adjacent ones.  Each weapon is at -4, in addition to any off-hand and hit location penalties.  Such attacks are difficult to defend against if aimed at a single foe.  The defender's attention is divided: -1 to defend against each attack of a Dual-Weapon Attack aimed at a sole opponent.  This applies to any number of attacks made with paired weapons.</pre>

Shargaas is a [[Dathairä]] said to inhabit a tremendous cavern system in [[The Circle Of Strife|Minauros]], or [[Minauros]] in the third layer of [[Baator]].  Her cavern extends infinitely, under the swampy filth of her realm, filled with darkness deeper than the blackest night.  In [[Minauros]], no creature has sight other than Shargaas herself.  She appears as a female humanoid form with tentacles extending from her head and back.  She is blinded by the light from the sun, but can see perfectly in darkness.  Up to 3 of her tentacles can grasp and function as arms, each with a weapon skill of 16.  She possesses a natural resistance to [[Magic]] and resists at +5.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Notable People/Stone Lands/Brand/sirina-lakshay.jpg]]

Sirina Lakshay is a hired guard for [[The Grey Companions]]. She is exotic and beautiful, and handy with the dual scimitars she wears at her side. She adorns herself with traditional [[Uskardeen]] jewelry, and speaks with a slight accent. She is known to have a bad temper, and be extraordinarily paranoid.

Sirina has skill in impersonations and acting.  She has the ability to counterfeit moods, emotions and voices, and to lie convincingly over a period of time.  She can also use makeup and clothing to pass as someone else - making it easy for her to disguise herself.

She speaks with flowery [[Uskardeen]] sayings that are foreign to the ears of many in [[Brand]], such as &quot;If you join the dance circle, you must dance&quot;, &quot;The camel does not see her own hump&quot; and &quot;You drown in a spoon of water&quot;.  When greeting or saying goodbye, she speaks the [[Uskardeen]] phrase &quot;Be Pleased&quot; and offers a deep bow.

Sirina gets very irritated when men act sexist, or presume women are less than men.  She values strength and fortitude, and admires [[Desini Orosco]] and [[Minerva Carrington]] for their power and confidence.

When Sirina has a goal or mission, there are no limits to the extent she will go in order to see it completed.  This translates to her fighting style, which shows no mercy and seeks to defeat her opponent with sheer force, determination and speed.  Her first assignment for [[The Grey Companions]] was to guard the door to the basement, where [[Sathric]] hibernated.  As he appeared as a fellow [[Uskardeen]], Sirina was drawn to him.  His strange mannerisms, shady story of his background, and endless hours spent alone in his room cause her great suspicion.  It will only be a matter of time before she finds out his secret.

There exist those rare individuals born with an innate connection to [[Mana]].  One is born a Sorcerer, it is not a talent that can be learned or taught - one either has the ability, or does not.  This close connection to [[Mana]] allows them to Sense and feel it, as others can feel a cool breeze or smell an impending rain.  Their deeper connection to [[Mana]] grants them unique abilities to Control their own their bodies and Alter the environment by bending [[Mana]] to their will.  Where a [[Wizard|Wizardry]] learns through regimented academic and scholarly study, a Sorcerer learns through natural exploration of their own innate talent.

!Sorcerer Traits
* ''Eschew Materials'' - You can cast any spell that has a material component costing your level in gold pieces or less without needing that component.  (For Example: a level 1 sorcerer could cast Comprehend Languages without requiring the use of salt or soot).
* ''Connection With Mana'' - You can cast Detect Magic at will, without expending a spell slot.  Additionally, you can passively perceive large uses of [[Mana]] from [[Wizards|Wizardry]] or Sorcerers ([[Divine Favor]], [[Nature Magic]] and [[Occultism]] do not use [[Mana]] and are therefore not detected in this fashion).

<pre>Soul Coins are artifacts forged in [[Dis]], The Second Circle of [[Baator]].  They are about 5 inches across and about an inch thick, minted from [[Infernal Iron]].  Each coin weighs one third of a pound, and is inscribed with [[Infernal]] writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul in the coin.  Because each coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story.  A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a curse.
To hold a Soul Coin is to feel the soul bound within it - overcome with rage or fraught with despair.  An evil creature can carry as many Soul Coins as it wishes.  A non-evil creature can carry a number of Soil Coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty.  Carrying more grants disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
Each coin has three charges.  When in contact with the coin, a charge can be expended to:
Drain Life: siphon away some of the soul's essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.
Query: telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic answer.  The soul only knows what it knew in life, and must answer truthfully and to the best of its ability.  The answer is no more than a sentence or two and may be cryptic.
Using the final charge destroys the coin and the soul within.  Soul Coins are used as currency in [[Baator]], and highly valued by those that live there.  The value of the coin is tarnished if charges have been consumed.
It is possible to free a soul trapped within a coin using powerful [[Magic]] in the form of a Greater Restoration spell.  The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed - releasing the soul into the plane of existence it belongs.  Evil souls find themselves emerging once again in [[Baator]] as a [[Soul Larvae]].</pre>

The Soulfiends were constructs of the necromancer [[Teldinath Dagon]] in what is known as [[The Demon Plague]].  The [[ritual|Blood Magic Rituals]] for channeling and creating a Soulfiend was quite complex, however the vessel must be a willing participant for the spell to succeed.  Once complete, the Soulfiend gave it's host an incredible boost of Strength (+6 Strength), Dexterity (+4 Dexterity) and speed (+20 feet of movement), and were very hard to kill (Soulfiends regenerate 1 hitpoint / turn).  They had the power to rip the soul out of a human victim once per long rest, by slowly reaching their hands within the victim's head.  While the procedure of extracting a soul was painful to the victim, it left no external scar or blemish.  The victim would regress into a drooling mindless state (Treat as a Feeblemind spell).  The Soulfiends require human souls to survive (treat as a dependency) or the demon inhabiting the host suffers from the Feeblemind spell themselves.</pre>

Sphinx are sacred creatures who have pledged their service to their creator, [[Qualok]].  They guard the secrets and treasures of [[The Gods]].  As it calmly regards each new party that comes before it, the bones of supplicants and quest seekers that failed to pass its tests lie scattered around its lair.  Its great wings sweep along its flanks, its tawny leonine body rippling with muscle and possessed of forepaws powerful enough to tear a humanoid in half.

They are diving guardians, who test the worth of those who seek them.  A sphinx maintains its vigil tirelessly, not needing to sleep or eat.  It rarely engages with others of its kind, knowing no other life except its sacred mission.

<pre>|Governor:|[[Dorn Stomgar]], [[Dwarf]], [[Shield]] of Stomgar's Quarry and [[Bannerman]] of [[House Eulien]]|
|Population:|4,000-6,000, 80% [[Human]], 20% [[Dwarf]]|
|Fortifications:|The city is built on the fertile floor of a massive canyon.  Large cliffs and mountains naturally defend it.  There are ensconces along the canyon walls allowing archers to serve as snipers in times of distress.  There is only one clear pass through the mountains that leads to Stomgar Quarry|
|Law:|100 guardsman|
|Resources:|Precious metals, gemstones, stonecutting (they have fantastic quarries that produce many types of stone), [[Bitterbrew]] (strong [[Dwarvish|Dwarf]] ale – said to be the best version ever made on the surface of [[Asha]])|

!Description
The city is built within a canyon beside the ruins of an [[Elven city|The Sylvan Empire]] that was originally built within the cliff face.  Ruins and small paths can still be found here.  [[Dorn’s|Dorn Stomgar]] grandfather, [[Dain Stomgar]], ran a quarry within the fertile canyon under the banner of [[House Eulien]].  He was quite successful and a few other [[clans|Dwarven Clans]] surfaced and took part in the profitable venture.  Eventually [[Humans]] settled here, chasing after the [[Dwarves’|Dwarf]] prosperity.

!Social Customs
* Once a year the city holds a competition which has contestants jump from [[The Leap’s|The Leap]] crest, and diving down the length of the canyon into the deep pool at the foot.  The dive is not for the faint of heart, or for those that are not accomplished divers.
* [[Kombar’Ran|Dwarf]] are prevalent in the city.  They are concentrated within a small suburb in which they retain their native language and culture, few [[Kombar'Ran|Dwarf]] in the district bother to learn the [[Human]] tongue.  The two conflicting cultures within the city often causes trouble or sources of intolerance and racism.

!Notable Characters
*[[Dorn Stomgar]] is kind but greedy.  He does not want to be [[Lord]] or any such nonsense, but it does pay well.  He gets by without running the city by personally appointing people to positions of authority that handle all the mundane activities.  His charismatic herald, [[Morgan Kane]], also helps him.  He and [[Morgan Kane]] are good friends but total opposites at the same time.  The thing that [[Dorn Stomgar]] hates most about being [[Lord]] is the popularity and status attached to the position.  He loathes public attention and lack of a private life.
*[[Lord’s Herald Morgan Kane]] is the lord’s servant in matters of public relations, diplomacy, writing speeches, arranging parties for visitors, and deals with both [[The Undermountain Papacy]] and [[The Divine Order]].  He is charismatic and well mannered; skilled in savoir-faire, diplomacy, law, and fast talking.  he is responsible for [[Dorn’s|Dorn Stomgar]] appearance and transforms the uncouth [[Dwarf]] into a respectful [[Lord]].  The Lord’s nickname for [[Morgan|Morgan Kane]] is ‘Little Pest’.
*[[Tromulen Kiro]] is a famed explorer of the [[catacombs|Stomgars Quarry Catacombs]] deep within the canyon walls.  It is he who has single handedly retrieved countless of artifacts, and dealt with the denizens of the deepest tunnels.  If one would wish to explore the [[catacombs|Stomgars Quarry Catacombs]], [[Tromulen|Tromulen Kiro]] would be a much needed guide.
*[[Derik Tippet]] is a local priest and healer.  He has created a local hospital where he can tend to the sick and needy.

!Places Of Interest
*[[The Dicing Dwarf]] is a gambling hall home to professional and novice gamblers alike.  Those that are quick to part with their money best stay far away.  The proprietor is [[Ferin Simgar]], a [[Dwarf]] that claims family ties to [[Lord Stomgar|Dorn Stomgar]] himself.
*[[The Leap]] is a rather magnificent cascade of waterfalls that stretches from the top of the canyon to the canyon floor.  It is the falls, and the lake it creates that keeps the valley fertile and lush.
*[[Kombar’s Eye]] is yet another [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] run tavern.  It serves the darkest [[Bitterbrew]] and its proprietor is known to lead the patrons in a loud drunken chorus (usually old ballads of battle).
*[[Stomgar’s Holdfast]] is a magnificent [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] built structure built directly into the cliff face.  [[Kombar’ran|Dwarf]] often see the building as tacky, often wondering why the whole structure wasn’t built underground.
*[[The Order’s Alms]] is a hospital run by [[Derik Tippet]], a local priest and healer, who wishes to mend the hurts of the Quarry’s townfolk.  The hospital is a place for one to go if they need to heal they wounds, or their souls.</pre>

Street rats are the true core of the city and they can be valuable to any adventure group that needs to work their way through the lesser known urban sections.  Outside of the city, they are scrappy fighters and fierce negotiators.

<pre>Strongholds are cities of the [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] people, often built into mountains or underground.  They are governed by a [[Dorn]] (translation from [[Dwarvish]]: &quot;King&quot;), and house thousands of [[Dwarves|Dwarf]].  Each Stronghold is a free city ruled by the [[Dorn]], who sets rules and laws for the Stronghold.  All Strongholds obey the word of [[Kombar]], and are devout followers of [[The Undermountain Papacy]].  Each Stronghold has a religious leader known as a [[Kestaz]] (translation: &quot;Holy&quot;) who is the mouthpiece of [[Kombar]].  He holds as much influence and power as the [[Dorn]], as he commands the [[Volg'gogan]], or &quot;the stone blessed&quot; - who are both priests and able to channel the [[Divine Favor]] of [[Kombar]].

Other important roles within the Stronghold include the [[Keluz'rond]] or &quot;Strongshield&quot; captain, who is the leader of the military.  It is their responsibility to protect the Stronghold in times of war, but also keep the peace.  The [[Taurak'talomar]] or &quot;Trade Master&quot; handles logistics of trade and settles disputes among merchants.  It is the trade master who ensures relationships with nearby towns and settlements are kept healthy.  The [[Volg'talomar]] or &quot;Stone Master&quot; leads mining operations for the Stronghold.  This includes planning mining expeditions, and ensuring a constant flow of ore.

[[Dwarven|Dwarf]] society is clan based, and each clan has a leader or representative.  This includes both family clans, as well as guilds such as blackmiths, brewers, and craftsdwarves.</pre>

<pre>|!See [[Blood Magic Rituals]]|

!Ardent Minion
|//''Required Components:'' A frog or toad, flesh from an aberration, blood from a sentient creature//|
|''Casting Time:'' 2 days|
|''Range:'' touch|
|''Duration:'' 1 week / level|
The caster spends one day marinating the flesh from an aberration within the blood of a sentient creature.  This rotting concoction is then fed to a frog / toad which within 24 hours transforms them into a [[Banderhobb]] by summoning spirits from another [[Plane Of Existence|The Planes Of Existence]].  The [[Banderhobb]] is a bipedal toad that exists to serve its creator.  During its brief existence, a [[Banderhobb]] attempts to carry out the bidding of the one who birthed it.  It accomplishes its mission with no concern for the harm it suffers or creates.  Its only desire is to serve and succeed.  A [[Banderhobb]] that is assigned to track down a target is particularly dangerous when it is provided with a lock of hair, a personal belonging, or other object connected to the target.  Possession of such an item will allow it to sense the creature's location from as far as a mile away.  It fulfills its duties until its existence ends.  When it expires it leaves behind only tarry goo and wisps of shadow.

!Call Nightmare
|//''Required Components:'' A soul of another creature.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 minute|
|''Range:'' 100 ft + 10 ft / level|
|''Duration:'' 1 week|
The caster calls a [[Nightmare]] into existence, offering it a soul of another creature that they have prepared.  In exchange, the [[Nightmare]] serves the caster for one week as a mount or guard, although if the [[Nightmare]] and caster are separated further than the range of this spell, the [[Nightmare]] immediately returns whence it came.  Multiple castings of this spell replace the previous [[Nightmare]] with a new one.

!Distort Summons
|//''Required Components:'' A living creature.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 action|
|''Range:'' 100 ft + 10 ft / level|
|''Area:'' 50 ft radius|
|''Duration:'' 1 day / level|
The caster sacrifices a living creature, and creates an area in which only evil creatures can be magically summoned.  No matter what a later caster attempts to summon, they actually summon an evil version (a fiendish beast rather than a celestial one) or an evil equivalent.
If the summoner was attempting to summon a good or neutral creature, the evil creature that appears does not obey the commands of the summoner or attack their enemies.  Instead, they attack the summoner, and the spell that summoned the evil creature cannot be dismissed.  A distort summons spell can be dispelled normally, however.

!Pentagram
|//''Required Components:'' A living creature.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 5 minutes per 5 feet protected|
|''Range:'' touch|
|''Duration:'' Permanent unless broken|
Produces a magical barrier which blocks hostile spells and magical creatures from passing in either direction.  It is a star-shaped figure drawn on the floor or ground.  Any area that is even partially within the pentagram is &quot;protected&quot;.  Magical creatures ([[Dathairä]], [[Golems|Golem]], [[Zombies|Zombie]], [[Elementals|Elemental]], and the like) cannot cross the border of a pentagram; neither may they cast spells, or move any physical object, across the border.  Non-magical creatures - including mages - can freely cross a pentagram, though they cannot cast spells across its border.  Spells of transport (Flight / Teleport) annot be used to enter a pentagram.
Certain very hostile creatures may be summoned //within// a pentagram; the caster stands outside and summons the creature to a space inside the pentagram.  The caster will open the pentagram only when he is sure he can control the summoned creature.
If part of the pentagram is cut or erased, its power will be lost until the caster can rejoin the pentagram - which requires this ritual to be performed again for the broken piece.  No magic spell may injure the pentagram, but physical attacks like walking up and scuffing out a line with your shoe can succeed if they are made by non-magical beings.  A [[Dathairä]] or creation could not do it; an ordinary person could.  Likewise, an ordinary person could throw a rock into a pentagram, but a [[Dathairä]] or [[Golem]] could not.
A magical creature may try to force its way through a pentagram.  Roll a contest between the creature's Strength/Athletics/Wisdom/or Arcana against the caster's Arcana or Wisdom.  If the creature wins, the pentagram is destroyed!  No one creature can thus &quot;test&quot; the pentagram more than once per day.
Upon creation of the pentagram, 1d10 of damage is required from living creatures which are offered as sacrifice for every 5 feet protected by the barrier.

!Soulfiend
|//''Required Components:'' A living, willing sentient creature, blood.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 day|
|''Range:'' touch|
|''Duration:'' permanent|
A subject becomes a willing host for a [[Dathairä]], merging their consciousnesses together known as a [[Soulfiend]].  The subject gains a boost to their physical attributes (+6 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +20 speed) and can regenerate 1 hitpoint / round.  They also have the ability to rip a soul from a living host by slowly reaching into their head.  This procedure leaves no blemish or scar, and leaves the victim a drooling mindless husk as per the Feeblemind spell.  [[Soulfiends|Soulfiend]] require souls to survive, else suffer from the Feeblemind spell effects themselves.
The ritual is performed by the willing subject to bathe in a pool of blood - while symbols are carved within their skin.  Upon completion of the ritual, the subject makes a Constitution saving throw of DC 12 - a failure and the ritual was unsuccessful.  A critical failure results in the subject's death.

!Summon Dathairä
|//''Required Components:'' A living creature.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 10 minutes|
|''Range:'' 10 ft|
|''Duration:'' 1 day / level|
Calls a [[Dathairä]] into existence from another [[Plane]].  The cast //must// immediately attempt to control the summoned creature through a contest of Wisdom, vs the creature's Wisdom or Strength.  If the caster wins, they can give the [[Dathairä]] a single command, which it will carry out literally.  If the demon can pervert the &quot;literal&quot; meaning to the caster's disfavor, it will.  The [[Dathairä]] will then vanish after completing their task.  It may work incidental mischief unless the caster carefully instructs it not to.
If the caster //loses// the contest, the [[Dathairä]] will immediately attack unless the caster is protected by a pentagram.  If it cannot break the pentagram, it will vanish (if it is in the pentagram) or escape and wreak havoc (if it is outside and the caster is inside).
If the caster knows the name of a specific [[Dathairä]], that specific [[Dathairä]] may be summoned and the caster has advantage to control it.  A randomly summoned [[Dathairä]] may be forced to tell its name.  This does //not// count as its &quot;one task&quot;, but //does// require the caster to win a separate contest of wills as stated above.  That [[Dathairä]] may then be summoned again by name.  The names of [[Dathairä]] are also sometimes found in old grimoires.
If no name is used during the summoning, the [[Dathairä]] is rolled using charts.  The caster may attempt to control the type of [[Dathairä]] it summoned.  1d6 damage is taken upon summoning of a creature - and an additional 1d6 damage can be traded for each table the die roll on each of the 7 tables.
Considering its destructive potential, this is actually a fairly easy ritual.  The reason is apparently that [[Dathairä]] want to be summoned, especially by those too weak or inexperienced to control them.
[[The Book Of Mig'dran]] describes the summoning of an [[Otyugh]], one of The Dark Young of [[Draizon]].

!Vomit Horror
|//''Required Components:'' At least one living creature.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 30 minutes|
|''Range:'' personal|
|''Duration:'' See Text|
This ritual causes the cast to vomit up a pool of vile, writhing inky horror, a demon-like entity that is formed from the taint in the caster’s own soul. The strength of the  monster  depends  on  the number of living creatures the caster sacrifices and kills during the ritual.  The monster counts as a demon with Hit Dice equal to the number of sacrifices,  up to a maximum of 15.  The monster will obey the caster’s psychic commands, and the caster may see through the creature’s eyes at will.  However, while the monster is manifest, the caster cannot heal naturally.  If the monster is slain or banished, the caster must make a Constitution save (DC  20) or die instantly.  The caster must physically touch the monster to reabsorb his blackened soul.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/tabaxi.jpg]]

Hailing originally from the continent of [[Caldoria]], the Tabaxi were a subjugated race subservient to the [[Dragonborn]].  The islands of [[Caldoria]] were sunk beneath the ocean sometime after [[The Cataclysm]] of [[The Second Age]]; only to be resurfaced in the year 1021 [[AAP]].  The raising of the island brought with it the Tabaxi's freedom from slavery.  Most left their homeland only to become wandering outcasts.
They are cat-like in appearance, with fur covered bodies, long tails, and retractable claws.  Their fur ranges from a variety of colors and patterns common to cats, leopards, and lions.  While uncommon, some males grow a mane of hair around their head like a lion.

!Wandering Outcasts
Most Tabaxi have fled their homeland of [[Caldoria]], seeking a new life free from slavery and subjugation by the [[Dragonborn]].  They find themselves unwelcome in most cities, and become homeless wanderers.  This suits their natural curiosity for stories, artifacts, and lore.  Their persisted ancestral slavery allows them to tolerate living within the cracks of civilization; sleeping within alleys, eating among the refuse, and begging for coin.

!Barterers Of Lore
The Tabaxi treasure knowledge rather than material things.  A chest filled with gold coins might be useful to buy food or a coil of rope, but it's not interesting.  In the Tabaxi's eyes, gathering wealth is like packing rations for a long trip.  It's important to survive in the world, but not worth fussing about.
Instead, Tabaxi value knowledge and new experiences.  Their ears perk up in a busy tavern, and they tease out stories with offers of food, drink, and coin.  Tabaxi might walk away with empty purses, but they mull over the stories and rumors they collected like a miser counting coins.
Although material wealth holds little attraction for the Tabaxi, they have an insatiable desire to find and inspect ancient relics, magical items, and other rare objects.  Aside from the power such items might confer, a Tabaxi takes great joy in unraveling the stories behind their creation and the history of their use.

!Fleeting Fancies
Wandering Tabaxi are mercurial creatures, trading one obsession or passion for the next as the whim strikes.  A Tabaxi's desire burns bright, but once met it disappears to be replaced with a new obsession.  Objects remain intriguing only as long as they still hold secrets.
A Tabaxi Rogue might happily spend months plotting to steal a strange gem from a noble, only to trade it for passage on a ship or a week's lodging after stealing it and uncovering it's secrets.  They might take extensive notes or memorize every facet of the gem before passing it on, but the gem itself holds no more allure once its secrets and nature have been laid bare.

!For The Pride
Tabaxi are social creatures, collecting into clans known as [[Prides|Pride]].  The females form the core of this social group and tend to remain in the same [[Pride]] from birth until death.  As a result of remaining in the same pride throughout their lifetimes, female Tabaxi within the same [[Pride]] are generally related to one another.  Due to this permanence, the Tabaxi [[Pride]] is most commonly matriarchal in structure.

<pre>Tar Barog (meaning &quot;The Navel Of The Oerth&quot; in [[Old Oeridian]]) was the capital city of [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]].  It housed the palace complex of [[Ammenon]], serving as his personal home.  Construction lasted 14 years, and required more than a million workers.  While destroyed at the end of the reign of [[The Whispered One]], it is assumed to be in the desolate region of [[Amon]] known as [[The Glasslands]], near the shore of a salt lake [[Udrukankar]].

At the center of Tar Barog is a circle of stone.  An artifact of sorts, more than a mile across.  Physically, it's a series of five concentric stone circles made of smooth, white pillars of unknown rock durable enough to withstand almost any force - even the one that eradicated its parent city.  Not just withstand it, but remain completely unscathed by the passage of time.  No scars, no weathering, and even no tool marks.

It must have been a great work to transport the pillars, which are some 40 feet high each, to their present site.  There is no rock of that sort within more than 200 miles, and indeed the origin of the stone is not known.

The stone circles are built upon the conjunction of ley-lines, and must have drawn great power from them.</pre>

Tarmon Gellius (c. 1868 [[IO]] to 1812 [[IO]]) was the [[Amoni|The Amoni People]] leader who sailed an army from [[Amon]] to [[Kellos]] in 1847 [[IO]], nearly 3000 years ago and tamed the savage land.  He spent most of his years in the unprecedented military campaign known as [[The Amoni Invasion]], helping create one of [[the largest empires in the world|The Amoni Empire]] for his [[Emperor]] [[Nicomedian Trier]].  He was undefeated in battle, and is considered one of the most successful military commanders ever to have lived.

[[The Grey Companions]], an adventuring band within [[The Stone Lands]] began as Tarmon's elite guard.  They were tasked with protecting him and his family.

In 1846 [[IO]], [[Nicomedian Trier]] died.  As the [[Emperor]] neglected to keep a firm rule over the vast extend of [[The Amoni Empire]], it crumbled into multiple successor [[Polités]].  Tarmon Gellius was declared [[King]] of [[Kellos]], and he severed ties with [[Amon]].  He ruled with absolute authority, and was a commanding presence.

Tarmon Gellius contributed much to the culture of the realms, beginning construction of [[The Westron Wall]] and introducing currency in the form of minting [[Red Queens]].

Upon his death in 1812 [[IO]], his son [[Mendos Gellius]] rose to power following a bloody battle of succession.</pre>

Tarmon Gellius II (c. 1799 [[IO]] - c. 1775 [[IO]]) was the last [[King]] of [[Kellos]].  He is remembered as &quot;The Frail King&quot; both for his physical ailments as well as his failings as a ruler.  He suffered from both Epilepsy and Hemophilia, and was therefore unable to be very active.  He sequestered himself away in his castle for protection, where he governed with a cruel demeanor.

Most notably he executed prominent heads of state (his own kin) as he felt they were mocking him.  This left a large power vacuum in what are now known as [[The Dales]] and [[The Green Sea]].  This combined with the decline of [[The Amoni Empire]] created the climate in which a quick and sudden political action saw him removed from office and [[A Republic|The Old Republic]] put in his place with shared rule among the major noble houses.  It is said he died while in custody, in prison the same year he was deposed.</pre>

The Airship Triumph was the first [[Airship]] made in 1021 [[AAP]].  It's maiden voyage was from it's parent city of [[Zylok]] to the city of [[Vedinium]] on the continent of [[Amon]].  [[Nester Arkwood]] enlisted the help of [[The Grey Companions]] when he was concerned of the threat of sabotage by [[The Elven Order]].  The sabotage occurred and was thwarted by [[The Grey Companions]], however the ship suffered heavy damage to the [[Arkstones]] crystals.  The damage caused the ship to speed up uncontrollably, much of the crew died before control was regained of the ship.  First Mate [[Klempton Reese]] assumed role of captain, with only [[The Grey Companions]], [[Enchanter|Enchantment]] [[Avix Ivumorn]], and the Sailors [[Destrian]], [[Merk]], and [[Pawlin]] surviving.

The ship had sped up past the full continent of [[Amon]], over the magical mist shrouded continent of [[Caldoria]] which at that time was submerged at the bottom of the ocean.  The ship was heavily damaged and sailing as a normal sailing vessel when it was attacked by [[The Guardian Of Caldoria]] before being sucked into a whirlpool - a giant maelstrom - that was created by the frequent breaches found in [[Caldoria's|Caldoria]] shield that guarded the city.

!Launch Of The Airship Triumph
The following speech was given by [[Eustacia Vaisanan]] and [[Nester Arkwood]] on the commencement and launch of the Airship Triumph:

@@[[Eustacia Vaisanan]] says &quot;We meet in front of [[The Athenaeum]] noted for knowledge, in a city noted for progress, in an [[Empire|The Viridian Empire]] noted for strength, and we stand in need of all three, for we meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and ignorance.

I am honored to introduce my dear friend and mentor, [[Nester Arkwood]].  He is the headmaster of [[The Athenaeum]], [[Zylokian|Zylok]] [[Arkanus First Class]], [[Distinguished Magus]] of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]], [[Lord Magister]] of [[The Magian Imperium]] - and the foremost expert of [[Enchantment]] in [[The Viridian Empire]].  [[Nester|Nester Arkwood]] is the inventor of the [[Arkstones]], and the lead designer of [[The Triumph Initiative]].  Please welcome, [[Nester Arkwood]]&quot;

[[Nester|Nester Arkwood]] begins, &quot;It is true, [[Eustacia|Eustacia Vaisanan]], that we are in need of strength, progress and knowledge.  However the greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds.  It is a striking fact that most of the [[Wizards|Wizardry]] that the world has ever known are alive and working today.  Despite that fact, the vast stretches of the unknown and the unanswered and the unfinished still far outstrip our collective comprehension.

Our ability to harness [[magic|Magic]] has increased Humanity's potential a thousand fold.  A single spell has the power to control nature to increase crop yields, cure many diseases and ailments, or do the work of a dozen men with a fraction of the effort.  So it is not surprising that some are content with our current progress.  Content to stay where we are and rest a little.  But this city of [[Zylok]], neigh the whole of [[The Viridian Empire]] was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them.  This [[Empire|The Viridian Epire]] was [[conquered|The Amoni Invasion]] by those who moved forward.

Yet with our understanding, Mankind is still within its infancy, with all of our knowledge we have yet to unlock the secrets of [[The First Age]].  An age of legends, filled with stories of our ancestors traveling the stars inside the bellies of eagles, or causing the whole world to weep for joy at a single performer.

This airship bears the name Triumph for it is one.  A Triumph of engineering and magery powered by enchantment.  [[Enchantment]] represents a new frontier of [[Wizardry]]... for it is with enchanted items that the power of magic becomes accessible to the general populace.  This ship is powered by an invention of mine that others have taken to call [[Arkstones]].  With them, this ship is capable of sustained flight across the [[Empire|The Viridian Empire]] at a speed that rivals horse and cart - and is expected to revolutionize trade and the economy.  Some of you may have arrived here through [[Teleportation]].  But [[Teleportation]] is costly, and impractical for commerce as it relies on the limited resources provided by a small handful of [[wizards|Wizardry]] trained in this advanced art.

I want to be the first to welcome you to a new age... and age of [[Enchantment]], where there are no limits to our possibilities.

The Airship Triumph will set sail for the city of [[Vedinium]] on the continent of [[Amon]].  An oversea journey that takes a traditional sailing vessel 18 days of travel.  The Triumph will complete the journey in only 3 days.  Docking towers like the one that stands behind me are built or under construction in nearly every major city that sits upon a shipping lane.  Before the year is out, Airship travel will revolutionize our society.

And therefore, as we set sail we ask for [[The Gods]] blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure in which man has ever embarked.  Thank You!&quot;@@</pre>

The Amoni Concord is the primary nation on the continent of [[Amon]].  Founded in 1479 [[IO]] after the fall of [[The Amoni Empire]], it is ruled by a loose federation of six leaders known as [[Tribunes|Tribune]].  Each [[Tribune]] governs a large geographical region of the continent known as a [[Polité]].

The Concord demands citizens pay a tithe, follow its laws, worship its gods, and bow to the installed local leadership (known as [[Lawmasters]]).  This accord has led to a prosperous century, primarily for the political elite known as [[Patriars|Patriar]].  Otherwise, most citizens of the Concord are left to their own devices.

A [[Tribune]] has ultimate authority over their lands and people.  These regions share in culture and free trade across [[Amon]], and consider themselves united in purpose despite being fragmented in rule.  This practice of governing is a vestige from [[Amon's|Amon]] troubled past, and the [[Amoni]] belief that no one person can be entrusted with the ultimate power of ruling [[Amon]].

!Magical Assassins
[[The Whispers]] are regarded by most citizens of The Concord as ghost stories and urban legends often told to children as bogeymen to warn against disobeying parents or staying out too late.  Only the Concord's elite are aware that [[The Whispers]] truly exist.  They are magically trained assassins that answer directly to the [[Tribunes|Tribune]].</pre>

<div title="The Amoni Empire" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="201602071535" modified="202106051315" tags="TBD" changecount="24">
<pre>The Amoni Empire was one of the oldest, largest and most powerful civilizations of [[Humans|Human]] of [[The Fourth Age]].  It was a fountain of science, art, and [[Magic]].  The Empire crumbled when at its greatest territory extent, when [[Nicomedian Trier]] (the last true [[Imperator]]) neglected to enforce his rule, and the vast territory was divided into multiple successor [[Polités]].

At its height, the empire covered all of [[Amon]], and most of [[Ruje]] and [[Kellos]].  Due to it's vast extent and long endurance, the institutions and culture of [[Amon]] had a profound and lasting influence on these territories.  [[The Amoni Language]] was a precursor to what modern day scholars refer to as [[The Common Tongue]].

The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity.

!Origins
The Amoni Empire was a response to the period of unrest and civil war marked by the overthrow of [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]] in 2127 [[IO]].  This period encompassed the career of [[Helio Gabreas]], who eventually rose to power through the chaos to become the first [[Imperator]] of [[Amon]].  There was a justifiable concern with placing ultimate power with a single individual, and [[The Amoni Assembly]] was established to keep the [[Imperator]] in check.

!The Power Of The Assembly
While the power of [[The Amoni Assembly]] waxed and waned over the centuries, at its creation it had the jurisdiction over criminal trials, regulation of festivals and religious cults, the granting of special honors, as well as the power to excuse an individual from legal liability.  It was [[The Amoni Assembly]] that created new legislation and who elected new [[Imperators]] after their death, as well as had the power to enact a vote of no confidence in a sitting [[Imperator]].

!The Fall Of The Amoni Empire
[[The Fall Of The Amoni Empire]] did not occur as one swift action, but as a slow and painful death.  In 1846 [[IO]] [[Imperator]] [[Nicomedian Trier]] suffered a prolonged illness that resulted in his death.  His death is marked by historians as the start of [[The Fall Of The Amoni Empire]].  [[Kellos]] immediately seceded from The Amoni Empire, declaring [[Tarmon Gellius]] [[King]].  In 1664 [[IO]], [[Ruje]] secedes from The Empire in a bloody conflict known as [[The War Of Scales]].  1522 [[IO]] saw a schism within the religious order of [[The Canticle]], spinning off a new sect calling themselves [[The Divine Order]], lessening [[Amoni]] influence across [[Asha]].  Less than 50 years later, in 1479 [[IO]], The Empire formally disbands into a collection of successor territories naming itself [[The Amoni Concord]].

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/bandor-ampitheater.jpg]]
The Amphitheater is a central attraction to all who visit [[Bandor]].  It is host to various forms of public entertainment such as plays or musical performances.  Most often talked about is the gladiatorial combats that are fought here.  The combats are held on the 10th day of every month.  Many attend, and the gambling is as savage as the fighting.

The combats themselves are rarely to the death.  Combatants are allowed to yield at any moment, for the local militia would treat a death as murder.  Although death is uncommon, the battles are brutal and often bloody.  Contests may include gladiatorial contests, magical duels, battles against animals, or anything else the depraved violence hungry crowd can cook up.

Characters may enter the arena voluntarily, Gladiators can easily earn $500 for winning a contest – more if the event is especially unfair, spectacular or well-sponsored.  Those contestants who yield make considerably less money.

Those who do break the few laws that exist in the city may find themselves as contestants in the next gladiatorial games.  Often these criminals have performed heinous crimes, and the arena battles are to the death.</pre>

!The Athenaeum
The Athenaeum is the most renowned and foremost place of [[magical|Magic]] learning in [[Asha]].  It is located in the city of [[Zylok]] within [[The Viridian Empire]] on the continent of [[Kellos]].  It houses a library of magical tomes, a meeting and social place for members of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]], and a university for aspiring [[magicians|Magic]].  It was founded in 27 [[IO]] by [[Waywill]], [[Armondax]], [[Mysara]] and [[Fazar]].

!The University
People from around [[Asha]] come to The Athenaeum to learn skills of [[Magic]] from the finest teachers in the world.  The first day of introduction, the students are welcomed by the headmaster and matched to an advisor that follows them through the decade of study required to complete their training.  Students attend at age 14, and study for 10 years.  The first half of the 10 years is considered Lower School, and the last 5 years are upper school - both upper and lower school each have their own Deans.  

!Student Independent Project
The [[Student Independent Project]] or S.I.P. is a requirement for graduation, where 10th year students complete a capstone project that answers an essential question, develops their own magical research, or displays exceptional understanding of arcane studies.  Students are given the final two weeks to work solely on their project, in preparation for presenting their project to the faculty and students of all grades.  Completion of a success [[S.I.P.|Student Independent Project]] is required for graduation, students with missed deadlines, incomplete work, and lack of progress may forfeit senior privileges and may be enrolled in supervised study to help manage the assignments and deadlines.

!The Rules
There are rules that all students must obey without question.
* ''DO NO HARM:'' students are expected to respect the sanctity of life.  Any harm done intentionally to another member of [[The Athenaeum]] community is grounds for immediate expulsion.  Intentional property damage is also dealt with accordingly.
* ''DO NOT CHEAT:'' students are here to learn.  When they cheat, they cheat themselves out of a proper education, and they cheat their friends out of a fair competition.  This is grounds for immediate expulsion.
* ''RESPECT THE STAFF:'' all members of the faculty are to be treated with the utmost respect at all times.  Students should use the appropriate honorific when speaking to any of the staff (“[[Lord]]”, or “[[Lady]]” are appropriate - however they prefer “[[Professor]]”).  Students must always listen to and obey the instructions of a member of the faculty.
* ''RESPECT THE STUDENTS:'' fellow students have come to [[The Athenaeum]] for one reason: to learn.  Students are given every opportunity possible to realize this ambition.
* ''OTHER:'' there are many other lesser rules at [[The Athenaeum]] such as &quot;no running in the halls&quot; or &quot;stay quiet in class&quot; - many  of these are rooted in both common sense and common courtesy.  If for some reason, a students needs these explained, they will find [[Headmaster]] [[Arkwood|Nester Arkwood]] is only too happy to expound upon these details at length, while they scrub the school's front gate or clean out the stalls in [[The Menagerie]].

!Faculty
| [img[images/characters/Athenaeum/sulyman-zaghul/sulyman-zaghul-portrait.jpg][Sulyman Zaghul]] [[Sulyman Zaghul]] |__[[Sulyman Zaghul]]__ is the [[Professor]] of [[Necromancy]] and [[Blood Magic]].  He is dark, brooding and mysterious.  Always keeping to himself, he never appears to relax or engage in friendly banter with students or faculty.  It is difficult to surprise him, as he is always ready for the unexpected.  |
| [img[images/characters/Athenaeum/seipher-black/seipher-black-portrait.jpg][Seipher Black]] [[Seipher Black]] |__[[Seipher Black]]__ is the professor of [[Metamagic]] and [[Teleportation]].

| [img[images/characters/Athenaeum/salix-daelof/salix-daelof-portrait.jpg][Salix Daelof]] &lt;br&gt; [[Salix Daelof]] |__[[Salix Daelof]]__ is a tough as nails [[Dwarf]], and the keeper of the menagerie.  He is excellent with the care of exotic animals.  He is boisterous, and will speak of anything other than the means by which he lost his eye.  He is good friends with [[Artimas Meliger]], as the two of them studied together as young boys in The Athenaeum.|
| [img[images/characters/Athenaeum/artimas-meliger/artimas-meliger-portrait.jpg][Artimas Meliger]] [[Artimas Meliger]] |__[[Artimas Meliger]]__ is the professor of [[Illusion|Illusion &amp; Creation Spells]].

| [img[images/characters/Athenaeum/mathius-vespian/mathius-vespian-portrait.jpg][Mathius Vespian]] [[Mathius Vespian]] |__[[Mathius Vespian]]__ is a strange and eccentric fellow.  No one living can remember the day in which Mathius was appointed official [[Book-Warden]] of the Athenaeum (not even Mathius).  This cheerful, yet aloof fellow is happy to assist all fellow researchers (if you can stand his endless descriptions of all things monotonous).  No one understands Mathius enough to accurately gauge his magical aptitude, but it is assumed to be high due to the fact that he is alive and kicking, even though he must be pushing 90 (no one known his exact age).  |

He is an extremely old [[Half Elf]] whose age has made him incompetent in anything other than the most simple spells (However Barnabus sees himself as important, and does not see the opinion others have of him).  He is hard of hearing, bad of sight, and many first year students end up taking advantage of his kindness and leniency. |
| [img[images/characters/Athenaeum/elene-cauldwell/elene-cauldwell-portrait.jpg][Elene Cauldwell]] &lt;br&gt; [[Elene Cauldwell]] |__[[Elene Cauldwell]]__ runs the administration for the Athenaeum, assistant to the Headmaster.

| [img[images/characters/Athenaeum/anthony-fudd/anthony-fudd-portrait.jpg][Anthony Fudd]] [[Anthony Fudd]] |__[[Anthony Fudd]]__ is the groundskeeper for the Athenaeum.  His crippled leg, bad temper, and vocal dislike for children making 'messes' that he needs to clean up gives him a very bad impression with the students.  He is one scary individual that isn't one to be trifled with. |

!Places Of Interest
* [[The Green]] is the central outdoor hub of The Atenaeum.  It is named after the green grass, topiaries, trees, and paths that connect the various buildings of campus.  The green is home to many of the clubs that students run, and is a central meeting place for students and faculty.  There are many benches and quiet nooks for students to congregate and study either in groups or individually.
* [[The Library Of The Athenaeum]] has magic texts exclusively stored for members of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].  The appointed librarians record access to materials that are deemed ‘questionable or dangerous’ (new acquisitions are first examined by the appointed [[Book-Warden]], who is the final judge).  It is said that the answer to every question is contained within these halls.  However, it is difficult to find materials pertaining to a certain subject and often requires both research and knowledge of the [[Elvish]] written language and a proficiency in magical research.
* [[The Cosmic Orrery]]  is a room within The Atenaeum at the top of [[The Tower Of Mysara]].  At the flick of a lever, a complex and delicate brass machine descends from the domed ceiling which can illuminate the room in patterns that resemble [[The Planes Of Existence]] using Illusory [[Magic]].
* [[The Athenaeum's Maker Space]] is a location stocked with materials that students can use in tinkering and crafting objects imbued with [[Magic]].
* [[Hawthorne Hall]] is the building that houses the faculty offices and bedroom suites.  Here faculty serve their office hours for student tutoring.  The [[Headmaster's Tower]] is connected to this building, complete with office, bedroom, and laboratory.</pre>

The Birth Of Light And Truth is a [[set of scrolls|Books and Literature]] written by [[Innocentius Lucaenus]] in 1522 [[IO]].  Its teachings enlighten on the foundational philosophies of [[The Divine Order]] and serve as its doctrine.

While this work mirrors [[The Chant Of Light]], it acts as a continuation in that it declares [[Valouria]] separate and distinct from [[The Gods]].  This created a schism in belief that led to the foundation of [[The Divine Order]].</pre>

<pre>The Black Fens are a swampland east of [[The Keep]].  The hot, muggy air and thick sludge-covered landscape is host to all manner of difficult terrain and terrible beasts.  The marsh is thick with Cypress trees and vegetation, with muddy waters reaching up to 10 feet deep in some places.  Deep within the fens lies [[The Whispering Bog]], a desolate landscape of mud and sorrow.

!Adventure Hooks
''They Shamble'' - People who enter the Fens have been disappearing.  Upon investigating, the PC's discover a [[Shambling Mound]] is capturing and eating unwary travelers.
''Renew The Mists'' - A [[Night Hag]] who calls herself [[The Moon Mistress]] and disguises herself as a [[Water Nymph]], uses the fading mists to shroud her location from a blood hunter named [[Perron Brill]], a woman dedicated to hunting [[The Moon Mistress] down out of revenge.  The mists require a blasphemous sacrifice to renew, and [[The Moon Mistress]] is willing to reward those who would aid her in retrieving the necessary components.  [[Perron Brill]] resides in a nearby villiage, and though she is no saint herself, more honorable PCs may think it best to help the hunter fund her prey.</pre>

The Bloodletter quill is a [[magical|Magic]] artifact used by [[Wizards|Wizard]] to transcribe special effects into their [[Spellbook]].  Powered by the caster's own blood, the quill resembles a creature of blood red skin with thorny appendages cascading down the quill.  The quill is carved from [[Bloodwood]], an exotic wood of red hue.  A singular glass eye is affixed to the hilt of the quill.

The origins of the quill are unknown, but are dated back to [[The Oeridian Kingdoms]] of [[The Third Age]].  Crafted in a time when [[Humans|Human]] were dabbling in the dark arts of [[Wizardry]] and [[Blood Magic]].

|statblock5e|k
|font-size: 23px;color:#7A200D;font-variant:small-caps;''The Bloodletter Quill''|
|//Wondrous item, Very Rare//|
|&lt;hr/&gt;|
|You can modify a spell in your [[Wizard]] [[Spellbook]] using this special pen, using your own blood.  You re-write the spell on your [[Spellbook]] with this quill using your blood instead of ink.  You can select one metamagic option listed below.  You lose the number of Hit Dice notes for each option applied to modify the spell.  For instance, if you use the quill to transcribe the //Extended Spell// feature onto a spell you lose 1 Hit Dice.  Furthermore, the losing of the hit dice reduces the maximum number of hit dice available to the character.  While the character can utilize the quill as often as they want, they cannot lose all of their hit dice.  To undo the effect of the Quill, it is sufficient to rip off the pages written in blood and destroy them.|
|__Metamagic options:__|
|* ''Distant Spell:'' (1 Hit Dice) The spell's range is doubled, or 30 feet - whichever is more.|
|* ''Empowered Spell:'' (1 Hit Dice per re-roll) You may re-roll 1 damage dice, but must use the re-roll.|
|* ''Extended Spell:'' (1 Hit Dice) For spells 1 minute or longer, you double the duration to a maximum of 24 hours.|
|* ''Heightened Spell:'' (1 Hit Dice) You cause disadvantage on any required saving throw|
|* ''Quickened Spell:'' (1 Hit Dice) A spell that takes 1 action can be cast in 1 bonus action.  Otherwise casting time is cut in half.|
|* ''Subtle Spell:'' (1 Hit Dice) You can cast the spell using only your [[Arcane Focus]] and no verbal or somatic components.|
|* ''Twinned Spell:'' (1 Hit Dice per spell level) When you cast a spell that targets a single creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can target a second creature in range.|</pre>

They journey here, at the end of their life, letting their life force be pulled from them within the [[Mana]] dead zone.

[[Familiars|Familiar]] will not cross the threshold into this place, and it is not safe to stay in The Boneyard for long.  [[Wizards|Wizard]] will find their use of [[Magic]] greatly diminished, and [[Sorcerers|Sorcerer]] will feel nauseous and weakened.  [[Wizards|Wizard]] with spell slots will lose 1 spell slot every 4 hours (starting with the lowest level slot) they remain here.  [[Sorcerers|Sorcery]] or creatures with innate magic lose a spell slot every hour.  These loses are permanent until a long rest is had outside of The Boneyard.

For miles around The Boneyard there is no life.  No trees, no grass, no birds or insects.  It is as if the lifeforce has been sucked dry from all living things.  Any vegetation that survives on the fringe is grey and withered.  This creates a field of desolation that is punctuated by pillars of natural stone that protrude from the grey ground like giant clawed fingers.

The ground is littered with the crushed bones of creatures that have died here, many bones brittle and unrecognizable due to age.  These crushed bones are ubiquitous and it is nearly impossible to travel The Boneyard without your feet crunching on bones.

!The Wickers
Floating around the area are small motes of concentrated magical energy that feed on other sources of [[Magic]] known as [[Wickers]].  These motes always travel in a straight line towards the center of The Boneyard known as The Sink, moving through creatures and objects to do so.  They are not intelligent and do not react to living creatures.

!Dead Magic Zones
There are many theories as to what causes a magical dead zone.  Perhaps there is something buried beneath the ground - some creature or device that is hampering the ability for [[Mana]] to coalesce.  Perhaps it is on a [[Ley Line]] network that is absorbing [[Mana]] into another [[Dimension]] or [[Plane Of Existence]].  Either way, any connection with [[Mana]] is either lost or significantly reduced while inside a dead magic zone.

!Mother Trudy
Living within the sun bleached ribcage of a [[Dragon]] is [[Mother Trudy]], a [[Hag]] who makes her living feeding off of the unlucky travelers who come her way.  She is fond of appearing in the guise of a woman in her mid 30's with long curly black hair and finely made clothing named [[Maren Trostentier]].</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/children-of-the-forge.jpg]]

The Children Of The Forge (or &quot;The Forged&quot;) were living beings who augmented their body with metal and [[Magic]].  They are powered by a [[Dragonshard]] made using [[Blood Magic]] and a plant known as [[Bluegloss]], which stains their organic parts pale blue.  The Children Of The Forge originate from [[Caldoria]], and are created by an ancient ritual from [[The Second Age]] performed by the [[Dragonborn]].  They are secretive with their process, and are selective in who they choose to join their ranks.  Currently, only [[Dragonborn]] pure-blood are permitted to take on the mantle of the forge.

Their power and prestige has waned over the generations.  It has become more difficult to find younglings willing to undergo the rituals to meld themselves to [[Magic]] and metal.  [[The House Of The Eternal]], their mighty stronghold in [[Caldoria]] is not much more than a grey stone ruin - not being repaired or extended in ages.  Even diminished, The Children Of The Forge command the respect of the [[Dragonborn]] of [[Caldoria]].

!Beyond Living
The Children Of The Forge are constructs.  They can experience anger, pain, fear and hatred like their original forms.  However they no longer require food, drink, sleep, or breath.  They do not sleep and instead enter a form of hibernation where they are completely inactive but fully aware of their surroundings.  For the uninitiated, a hibernating Child Of The Forge may be mistaken for a statue.

!Transference
The Forged were born living beings.  They wished to extend their lives to seek immortality, and were willing to use [[Blood Magic]] to achieve it.  For a living being to become a Child of The Forge, they must take part in multiple [[Transference Rituals|The Transference Ritual]] in which they unnaturally augment their bodies with metal and [[Magic]].  As the ritual is taking place, the being's consciousness is also changed - and with each ritual becomes more callous and disconnected from the living.  Those who don't prescribe to the beliefs of The Children Of The Forge suggest their very soul has been stripped away or altered, revealing a new entity entirely.  There are many risks with the ritual, in which the host may die or become a mindless version of themselves.

The ritual requires the magical essence of a flower native to [[Caldoria]] known as [[Bluegloss]].  In all forms it is lethal if consumed by the living, but can be magically distilled to form a crystalline structure that acts as a power source for The Child Of The Forge.  These crystals, known as [[Dragonshards|Dragonshard]] are difficult to manufacture using a secretive technique.  The [[Dragonshard]] is created through [[Blood Magic]] and [[Sorcery]], and can be very volatile until placed under the skin of the host.

!Upkeep
Even the eldest of The Children Of The Forge, who have gone through thousands of [[Transference Rituals]] retain portions of their original organic body.  This body responds to natural healing and healing [[Magic]], however their metalic parts require upkeep.

The [[Dragonshards|Dragonshard]] that power The Children Of The Forge last anywhere from 3-5 years, though some accounts vary.  The [[Dragonshard]] must be replaced or the creature will die; this creates a dependency on a supply of [[Bluegloss]] to extend their life.  As this [[Dragonshard]] is needed to power their form, they can only survive for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 30 seconds).  When this time has elapsed, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until the power source is replaced.

!Modification
The Children Of The Forge revel in modifying and improving their form.  This is similar to an addiction, and there are those who have modified their body beyond recognition.  They have added wings, multiple limbs, weapons, and armor.  After multiple modifications, The Children Of The Forge lose their connection to their former self and see no limit to their potential.

The Chrono Ocullum is an enchanted artifact made by [[Erik Doorhaus]] in 1023 [[AAP]].  It is a brass amulet with arcane symbols around the edge and a deep purple refined [[Residuum]] crystal that glows bright blue when activated.

When created, the Chrono Ocullum became unstable and warped [[The Eternal Cycle]] itself, launching [[Erik Doorhaus]], [[Minerva Carrington]], and [[Desini Orosco]] into a time loop.  In doing so, they created a time paradox in which they assisted [[Nester Arkwood]] in re-discovering [[Enchantment]], launching the career of [[Sanders]], and inadvertently creating [[The Emerald Order]].

<pre>The Demon Plague was a pandemic of [[Magical|Magic]] origin in the region of [[Kellos]] during 24 [[IO]].  History tells us that a group of cultists called [[The Holy Scourge]] who worshiped the might of [[Azarad-Ji]] were attempting to bring about a new [[Desecration]].  It is believed now that their goal had been to wipe out the weak element of the [[Human]] race, so that only the followers of [[Azarad-Ji]] would remain.  They wanted to prove their loyalty and earn his favor.  Many believed that they themselves had hoped to break open [[Azarad-Ji's|Azarad-Ji]] prison, and become immortal [[Kiraga]] and build an empire for their master where the others had failed.
	
[[The Holy Scourge]], led by [[Teldinath Dagon]] used their magic to draw into this world a curse woven by the [[Dathairä]] that when unleashed drew out the darkest parts of the [[Human]] soul.  The Demon Plague spread like wild fire, leaving madness and war in its wake.  Those it effected began to change, developing powers and vileness not unlike the [[Dathairä]] known as [[Soulfiends]].  They fought amongst themselves.  The taste of blood being the only thing to satisfy them.  It is believed that the plague enveloped [[The Holy Scourge]] as well.

It was not until four powerful wizards joined forces: [[Armondax]], [[Mysara]], [[Waywill]] and [[Fazar]].  Together, they beat back the plague and brought humanity back from the brink of destruction.  It was this act, that caused them to form what is now known as [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].</pre>

<pre>The [[Uskardeen]] were people living on the continent of [[Uskard]] spanning a thriving civilization.  Their culture was heavily reliant on [[Blood Magic]], and suffered great loss due to an undocumented magical event which caused their government to crumble in 29 [[IO]].

A young [[Uskardeen]] princess known as [[Vesna Zeuxis]] was blessed with the gift of [[Foretelling]].  She saw in a vision the destruction of her homeland, and tried to warn her people.  Many believed her vision, but not her paranoid father.  Against her father's order, [[Vesna Zeuxis]] and her followers began preparing for a journey to flee across the sea.  He sent an army to stop his daughter and her followers from leaving.  As the army approached, dark red clouds formed in the sky - and the princess knew the destruction had begun.  Fire rained from the sky, destroying the fleet of ships and the approaching army.  Refugees clung to rafts and makeshift vessels and traveled the great distance to [[Kellos]], where they assimilated into the culture.

Their magical influences tainted the culture of the people of [[Kellos]], who were being ravaged by [[The Demon Plague]].  The [[Uskardeen]] were shunned and only found solace in the barren desert now known as [[The Waste]].  Both [[The Demon Plague]] and the refugees from [[Uskard]] caused [[Cyril Viridian]] to begin his war on magic known as the [[Azutan Nagyos]].</pre>

The Divine Order is a religious institution within [[The Viridian Empire]] that furthers the ideals and tenants of [[The Gods]].  It is highly organized, and ubiquitous across the realm, with churches and places of worship in every town and village of [[The Empire|The Viridian Empire]].  This makes The Divine Order one of the single most influential groups in all of [[The Viridian Empire]].  It is an important social institution, teaching temperance and patience in all things.

!The Great Schism
The Divine Order was formed in 1522 [[IO]], predating [[The Viridian Empire]] by more than 1,500 years.  Breaking from the teachings of [[The Canticle]] in [[Amon]], The Divine Order broke from tradition in not considering [[Valouria]] as one of [[The Gods]] of worship.  This religious schism further fractured the ties between [[Kellos]] and [[Amon]].

!Worship
No god is worshiped singly or more than another, [[The Gods]] [[Umwe]], [[Qualok]], [[Lucian]], [[Kombar]], and [[Xander]] are all worshiped equally and together.  [[The Birth Of Light And Truth]] is an ancient tome written by [[Innocentius Lucaenus]], who is considered to be the founder of the philosophy of The Divine Order.

!The Clergy
[[Priests|Priest]] of [[The Divine Order]] are expected to live respectful of life, live honestly, and never be untruthful.  They are known to travel great distances to teach these doctrines to others.  Greed, cruelty, laziness, and jealousy are shunned.  It should be noted that The Divine Order has a strong presence in [[The Viridian Empire]], and a wandering member may find aid in one of the many churches or temples throughout the land.  The Order claims all of its members as children, and gives them personal aid whenever it is possible.  The church may assist with room and board, living expenses, necessary travel supplies, or support in times of a crisis.  Every member has a commitment to support their members in times of need.</pre>

[[The Gods]] take pleasure in this comfort, whereas some entities like [[Azarad-Ji]] chafe at the thought that their actions are being countered.  However, The Eternal Cycle has no intent in its actions; it is a force of the natural cosmos.

The Eternal Cycle has strange effects on the mortal [[Races]] with no lasting memory of time, creating patterns and themes that can be seen repeated over [[Ages|History]].  History begins to repeat itself for them: civilizations rising and falling; charismatic leaders arriving in times of great need; and discovery of thought and knowledge of what was once lost in another [[Age|History]].

[[Desecration]] is the name of an act that subverts The Eternal Cycle and works with an intent to undo it.  The [[Elf]] [[Raime Wesewierë]] was the author of the [[BahaUlla Prophecy]] - a story of how the struggles of the universe will end.</pre>

The Feywild is a magical wonder to all who lay eyes on its soil, [[Magic]] runs more freely in this plane and it pulses in the very air. Unless one can not be glamoured or is given the sight through another means, they can not help but be drawn to the beautiful chaos around them. In daylight, this charming magical land of wonder smells of fond dreams, candlelight, and of childhood hopes. Night brings the constant revelry and steady beating of drums where dancing seems most inviting. The luring song sings softly of days without worry and nights without fear. While this captivating land may seem perfect and pure, nothing is as it seems. Long peaceful days of dancing in the moonlight may be covering tear-stained faces and bleeding feet.

The Feywild is built like a trap to bring unknowing victims into its web and use their mortality for entertainment among the lands. Accepting anything from a [[Fey]] would count as taking a gift from them, and in turn would put a creature in their debt which is something they never would want to have happen. One must tread carefully and listen more than they speak. Time run differently in the Feywild compared to [[The Material Plane]], and even a short visit to the Feywild could be equivalent to a year or a matter of minutes.

Names hold power.  Say a [[Fey's|Fey]] name in full and true power can hold them still. To avoid this mythical fate all the [[Archfey]] hold [[Elven|Elf]] names. In the rare case that someone comes across one of the [[Fair Folk|Fey]] they will be more than happy to give the information sought in exchange for any shiny thing in a pocket, they do not take unfair trades lightly. To save a [[Fey]] would put them in debt and they will try to find the quickest way out of the bargain.</pre>

The First Age is known as The Age Of Gods.  It was a time when Life flourished and shown so bright, only to so arrogantly attempted to usurp the power of [[The Creator]] - to their own demise.  Their folly loosened the binds of the dark one [[Azarad-Ji]] and nearly destroyed [[The Eternal Cycle]] itself, resulting in [[The First Desecration]].  Only legends exist of this Age, crafted from fragments of hazy images wrested from [[The Eternal Cycle]] itself by sorcerers.

The First Age was a time before [[Magic]], before [[The Gods]] as they are currently known.  A time in which [[mankind|Human]] ruled over nature with technology and science.  This age was modern-day Earth, before [[The First Desecration]] ended everything and gave birth to other [[Races]], [[Dimensions]], and [[Magic]].

!Legends
The legends that have been gleaned through magic have a starting resemblance to real-world Earth history.
* The story of &quot;good King Ham who mournfully warred with his own brother in order to bring peace&quot; resembles Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War.
* &quot;The Dark Lord Adler whose genocidal scourge brought the world to war was defeated on the backs of an army of giant birds&quot; is most likely depicting Adolf Hitler in World War II, with the birds being aircraft.
* &quot;Feld, the jester, whose performances could make the world weep with joy&quot; is clearly the comedian Jerry Seinfeld.
* Readers will note that the legend of &quot;The folly of the Gods when they created an eye that could pierce into the inner recesses of the universe itself, only to find something peering back&quot; has similarities to The Hubble Telescope that is used to explore the galaxy.
* &quot;The story of Ram, and how he alone could stop large armies with the skill of his bow and knife&quot; appears to be the fictional character from the movie &quot;Rambo&quot;
* &quot;In an effort to unlock the secrets and power of [[The Creator]], so ended The First Age when they instead unraveled [[The Eternal Cycle]] itself, and therein loosened the binds of [[Azarad-Ji]]&quot; was most definitely The Large Hadron Collidor [LHC].
* &quot;The story of how every living being on the planet was connected in heart and mind&quot; telling of the Internet

!Artifacts
No artifacts from The First Age are known to exist, so much turmoil and change has occurred to have wipe out evidence from this Age.  Unbeknownst to the world and to it's owner, [[Abram Unger]] owns photographs that date to this age.  They are fuzzy and difficult to make out.

Unbeknownst to those of [[The Fourth Age]], [[The First Age]] was was also a time of [[Mankind|Human]].  The events of this age parallels that of modern Earth history.  The exploration of the theories of creation itself causes a tear in the dimensional fabric which nearly causes the extinction of [[Mankind|Human]].  Scientists stabilize the tear, ending [[The First Age]].  However the resulting upheaval, known as [[The Cataclysm]], engulfs the majority of the [[next age|The Second Age]] and reduces [[humanity|Human]] to a single scattered cluster that they won't recover from until [[The Fourth Age]].

Very little is known of this time - a time before magic.  What scraps and fragments that can be uncovered are only legends.</pre>

The Followers Of Joro began as a small group of individuals within the city of [[Laranor]] circa 995-997 [[AAP]], following the teachings of [[Gavar Joro]].  After [[Gavar Joro]]'s untimely death, belief in his idea that the universe was ruled by [[One True God]] began to spread.  [[Gavar Joro]] believed that [[The Eternal Cycle]] could be broken, and a new world of hope and prosperity could exist.  This belief mirrors [[BahaUlla Prophecy]] of [[The Sylvan Empire]].

!Teachings Of Joro
[[Gavar Joro]] had visions and prophecies of the past and future, and wrote of many fantastical things.  His teachings to this day are still undecipherable to even his most ardent of followers.  Some of the more confusing prophecies include:

* The city by the sea
* Chivasso will plot for the eagle
* The great tomb of the people
* in the land of the mountain people
* when the eclipse of the sun will then be
* the monster will be seen in full day
* the willing blow will put out his eye
* the five strangers entered the temple, their blood will come to pollute the land
* the tree which had long been dead and withered.  It one night will come to grow green again
* two brothers will wage war so fiercely
* a serpent seen near the royal bed, it will be by the lady at night, the dogs will not bark
* the moon is obscured in deep gloom
* his brother becomes bright red in color
* the great one hidden for a long time in the shadows will hod the blade in the bloody wound
* the children of the morning
* near the gates and within two cities there will be two scourges the likes of which was never seen
* famine within plague, people put out by steel, crying to the creator for relief
* beasts ferocious from hunger will swim across rivers.  
* The greater part of the region will be against the hister.  The great one will cause it to be dragged in an iron cage</pre>

The Fourth Age, also known as &quot;The Age Of Man&quot; is the current age in [[Asha's|Asha]] [[History]].  It began after the fall of [[The Sylvan Empire]] in 2127 [[IO]] and is chiefly dominated by the rise of [[Human]] civilization.  While their lifespan's are shorter than those of other races, the [[Humans|Human]] have an insatiable appetite for expansion and progress - and in a small amount of time have accomplished much.

!The Amoni Invasion
While [[Humanity|Human]] clung to existence in fragmented tribal clans across the globe, it was in [[Amon]] where one of the first [[Human]] civilizations flourished and grew.  From the ashes of a shattered empire from [[The Second Age]], [[Amon]] rose as a dominant force on the planet.  They built large sailing vessels and explored many of the far reaches of [[Asha]].  Upon finding the vast untapped resources of [[Kellos]], [[Amon]] launched a campaign to claim the untamed lands for themselves - known simply as [[The Amoni Invasion]] led by the [[Amoni]] military leader [[Tarmon Gellius]]

!The Destruction Of Uskard
[[Uskard]] was said to be a jewel, with lush jungles that were a deep verdant green.  The [[Humans|Human]] that made there home here called themselves the [[Uskardeen]], and built a civilization based on [[Magic]].  A cataclysm in 29 [[IO]] saw [[The Destruction Of Uskard]], where thousands of [[Uskardeen]] found refuge in [[Kellos]].

!The Demon Plague
[[The Demon Plague]] was a pandemic of [[Magical|Magic]] origin in the region of [[Kellos]] during 24 [[IO]].  A group calling itself [[The Holy Scourge]] using [[Blood Magic]] attempted to bring about a new [[Desecration]].  This event saw to the birth of [[The Viridian Empire]] and started a scourge of anti-magic sentiment that saw to the [[Azutan Nagyos]] or &quot;The War Of Mages&quot;.  This war ended with a truce, and the creation of the organization known today as [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].

!The Raising Of Caldoria
[[Caldoria]] was a lost continent, sunk to the bottom of the ocean in [[The Second Age]] by [[Dragonborn]] elders.  In 1021 [[AAP]], [[The Grey Companions]] stumbled upon the sunken and lost civilization and assisted in raising it from the sea floor.  Today, many of the islands float about the sea supported by ancient [[Magic]].</pre>

<pre>The Garden Of Ashzun is a lush tropical paradise within the middle of the city of [[Anmanu]] on the floating continent of [[Caldoria]].  Trees provide shade to many raised beds of blue flowers known as [[Bluegloss]] that give off a sickly sweet smell.  The garden is tiered, with water slowly pouring from clay pipes in the walls, irrigating the garden beds.  [[The Children Of The Forge]] require these flowers as components for their rituals which extend their life.

The garden is shadowed by a grey ruin of a building known as [[The House Of The Eternal]], the seat of power for [[The Children Of The Forge]].  An archway in the back of the garden leads down a set of stairs into the darkness of the aqueduct where [[The Heart Of The Island]] can be found.</pre>

The Gauntlet is a group of rough and tumble mercenaries that are headquartered in [[Bandor]].  They are known for their fearless and surgical style of executing their assignments.  The group is run by a council known as the ‘Heads’.  The Heads then inform the ‘Swords’, who are the approved members of The Gauntlet of upcoming jobs.  Swords can then elect whether they wish to participate in the posted job.  Heads determine who gets the job if there are too many applicants.

Swords have the authority to hire agents outside of the Gauntlet.  The Sword is then responsible for their payment and the fair treatment of his hirelings.  In this way, an older or crippled Sword may hire a party to complete a requested job.  These hirelings would most often then be offered their own membership within the Gauntlet.

The Gauntlet’s size is known only to the Heads.  However it is suspected that their numbers are small, for they only allow members who are elite mercenaries.  The members all wear the symbol of the chained fist on their shoulder, distinguishing their allegiance to one another. It is expected that all Gauntlet members act civilized and respectful when wearing the symbol.  The symbol generates an aura of respect, and is a mark of a seasoned warrior.  Members who act disrespectful when wearing the symbol are severely punished and face banishment from the group.

The Gauntlet will perform any task that is requested, even those that may seem morally dubious.  The price for hire is high if the Gauntlet is required to put their members life at risk, and higher still if the job is illegal.</pre>

<pre>!Introduction
The Fellowship is a collective of mages throughout [[Asha]], bound together by a simple philosophy and a common goal.  Their highest purpose is to advance the study of magic and expand their understanding of its unlimited potential. Among The Fellowship, personal differences are set aside in order for mages to pursue what is truly important.  First off, all mages of this collective are expected to assist one another in magical training.  It is expected that there be an open exchange of information between fellows.  Also, a fellow should never ignore another fellow’s reasonable request for aid.  

However, most fellows consider themselves students of an immense science.  Most do not consider themselves adventurers at all and are not going to involve themselves directly in a dangerous quest.  PC fellows should assume that the very powerful wizard that lives in the tower outside of town is probably busily involved in important study or great matters.  While he may point a PC in the right direction and give some useful advice, he probably won’t drop everything and join the party that’s on its way to kill a big bad guy.

Also, there is an understanding among the fellowship not to harm other members intentionally (outside of open war).  Of course there may be powerful wizards on both sides of a dispute.  Because they are fellows does not mean that they will not have to face each other.  Often in these situations, fellows hold a civilized (though sometimes extremely heated) parlay before battle.

Finally, hospitality is expected between fellows.  Nevertheless, fellows are cautious not to take advantage of their host (sometimes to the point that it is sickeningly polite and painful to watch).  If a Fellow refuses service to another fellow outright, he will gain a bad reputation among the Fellowship and eventually be shunned by it entirely.

Aptitude with [[Wizardry]] or [[Sorcery]] is the prerequisite for entry into the fellowship.  Also, a mage must be sponsored by an active fellow and have learned the spell Fellowship.

!Joining The Fellowship
Those interested in joining the Grand Fellowship of Mages must first find a sponsor.  This sponsor will then (if agreed) teach the [[Fellowship Spell]] to the new recruit - which is used to identify oneself as a member.  Those who don't follow the established code of honor (Never attack another Fellow unless in a fair, open duel; Always be polite and courteous to other Fellows; Never take advantage of another Fellow’s generosity) are shunned.

!Hidden Symbols
Members adorn their homes with discrete hidden symbols that declare the residence a promise of hospitality.  [[The Grand Fellowship of Mages]] is very secretive of their symbols and lore to outsiders, such that it is rare for the ability to read these symbols be given to anyone outside of their organization.  The symbols are drawn using a [[Fellowship Symbols Spell]], and visible only by those that can detect magic.

!History Of The Fellowship
The Fellowship was formed thousands of years ago, in 24 [[IO]] during a troubled time known as [[The Demon Plague]].  When the plague had reached civilized lands, a great battle had been going on between [[Armondax]], the Wizard of Brimstone and [[Mysara]], Lady of Shadowy Depths. Both mages felt the cold grip of the plague destroying the very thing they were fighting one another for.  The two had no choice but face a truly evil enemy together.  Their differences and goals seemed petty in comparison.  The two great wizards used their magic to protect those not yet effected.  Together they could keep the monstrous humans at bay, but they couldn’t hold out indefinitely.  During the last days, when supplies had been running low, [[Fazar]] the Wizard Knight brought an army to support them.  The fight kept going until [[Waywill]] Lifehealer arrived with a group of healers.  It was when all four mages concentrated their efforts were they able to devise a powerful magic that would cure the plague.  Each carried the cure to the neighboring cities, and the cure began to spread.  The desecration of humanity had been saved by their efforts.  It was with these four that the fellowship began.  The group grew, incorporating other powerful wizards.  Originally they were known as [[The Fellowship of Grand Mages]].  They sought out the most powerful [[wizards|Wizardry]] around the world to join their pursuit of knowledge and end the bitter rivalry that was common among them.  During this time [[Mysara]] and [[Armondax]] had a son, and when he was initiated into the fellowship he began initiating any noble mage he could find.  Apprentices and Archmages alike, made the fellowship great.  It was renamed The Grand Fellowship Of Mages, as all agreed that it was the fellowship that was great, not the individual mage.

The Grey Book is a tome the [[The Grey Companions]] use to record the deeds of all past members.  Each member has a page dedicated to who they are, how they joined, and how they either fell in battle or were forced to leave the group due to age or infirmity.  The book is only available to members of the elite group.

The book's cover is exquisitely made.  It has a hard leather-binding, inlaid with a black onyx gemstone, and gold filigree.  The cover is green scale hide from an unknown reptilian creature (assumed to be a dragon).  It includes a silver clasp and strapping.

On the first page of the book reads the creed of [[The Grey Companions]]:
//Hear my words and bear witness to my vow.  I am the sentry that guards the realm, I am the warden of the seeds of chaos, I am the light that darkness fears, I am the torrent of power I unleash upon my foes.  We will strike the final blow, for only death can remove us from our steadfast course.  Power.  Restraint.  Sacrifice.//

<pre>[&gt;img[images/organizations/the-grey-companions-symbol.jpg]]
The Grey Companions is the name of an ancient order that has history stretching back nearly 3000 years ago to the times of [[The Amoni Invasion]].  At that time, The Companions were a small elite force loyal to the leader of the invasion [[Tarmon Gellius]].  With the help of The Companions, he conquered and civilized the lands of [[Kellos]] and brought order and law that still stand to this day.

After the death of [[Tarmon Gellius]], The Companions became a private guild of adventurers for hire.  They have always been based in what is now known as the city of [[Brand]] in [[The Stone Lands]].  While they have no formal political allegiances, they have always stood for honor and protection of the less fortunate of the realm.  Their deeds are legendary, and have tremendous favor and respect from the common folk.

Gaining membership into the group is quite difficult, as they are quite particular as to the nature of those that seek to join.  Individuals must posses the potential of greatness, must be willing to place the good of the group above themselves, and must adhere to the strict code of The Companions (Never disparage yourself or the honor of The Grey Companions or minimize your strength or power, Never desert a comrade in need, Never withdraw on allegiance once granted, Never fear to hurt another in a just cause)

[[The Grey Book]] is a tome the group uses to record the deeds of all of its past members.

<pre>The Hall Of Thrones is the political seat of power in [[Caldoria]] located within the center of the city of [[Anmanu]].  It is a towering citadel with a grand audience chamber.  Outside the Hall is a large open forum with a row of five pillars on each side of a set of stairs leading to the main building on top of a hill.  On each pillar stands a statue of a [[Dragonborn]] roughly one and a half times their natural size.  Each is carved from a unique stone or metal (Obsidian, Jade, Alabaster, Lapis Lazuli, Ruby, Silver, Bronze, Gold, Copper and Brass) representing the ten scale colors of the [[Dragonborn]].  They represent a [[Dragonborn Elder]] of that color who is held in high respect and honor.

The Hall serves as the seat of power for [[the pure-blood Council Of Elders|The Council Of Elders]].  Ten [[Elders|Dragonborn Elders]], purest of the draconian lineage sit and confer silently to direct the course of events on behalf of [[Caldoria]].

The citadel boasts tall and delicate round white spires capped with colorful tiled roofs and topped with waving banners.  Two heavy doors grant entrance to the main chamber; a cavernous audience chamber with pillars holding up a cathedral ceiling.  Each pillar has carved on it fanciful creatures and events of [[Caldoria]].</pre>

<pre>Anyone with even a hint of [[Elven|Elf]] blood can't help but feel it stir upon setting foot in the High Forest.  The sheer age and the power of the trees, the depth of their roots, and the wind whispering through their leaves - all these things call to us.

A vast forest in the mist of the North, the High Forest is a reminder of ages past, when thick woods blanketed much of [[Asha]], and [[The Sylvan Empire]] was at its zenith.  This forest has barely known the tread and touch of any feet other than the [[Elves|Elf]], and old growth dominates its flora.  The [[Forana'loloKashira]] cities that are found within are built into the environment as to leave the woods untouched, wild, and natural; but there are ruins here from [[Ages|History]] past.  The bones of [[The Sylvan Empire]] still lie tangled within the forest's roots.

This forest is one of the primary secretive [[Havens]] for the [[Forana'loloKashira]], and few beyond the forest known of life here.  They are protective of their land, and travelers in The High Forest must be wary of [[Elves|Elf]] they meet for they can never be sure of their welcome, and any promises of safe passage might not be honored by the next band of [[Elves|Elf]].

Within the depths of The High Forest is an entire mountain range known as [[The Star Mounts]].  Constant strong winds keep flying creatures from piercing the forest from the mountains.  At a distance, the peaks glitter as if light reflecting from massive crystals dotting their slopes.</pre>

<pre>[[Teldinath Dagon]] was a cruel and calculating man.  He was once a talented mage, however his magical pursuits soon led him down a dark path.  Dagon delved into the black arts of [[Blood Magic]], learning the names of some of the vilest demons.  Nearly 1000 years ago, Dagon summoned a demon by the name of [[Zezebazum]], the very minion of [[Azarad-Ji]] responsible for [[The Third Desecration]] that vanquished [[The Great Sylvan Empire]] thousands of years before Dagon's birth.  [[Teldinath Dagon]] knew [[Zezebazum]] was powerful, and constructed potent magical wards to contain the demon.

Much to his suprise, he found [[Zezebazum]] to be quite pleasant and cordial.  Unlike the other demons he summoned, [[Zezebazum]] spoke with [[Teldinath Dagon]] at great length, answering all of his questions of ancient history.  [[Zezebazum]] spoke of how [[Azarad-Ji]]'s [[Kiraga]] had failed, and perhaps the right HUMAN could earn [[Azarad-Ji]]'s favor.  [[Zezebazum]] promised [[Teldinath Dagon]] imortality and unrestrained power over the mortal realm, if he were to help free [[Azarad-Ji]] from his prison.  The prison was strong and unyielding, however a demonic beast could be created strong enough to cause a tear in the fabric of the prison, thereby giving [[Azarad-Ji]] a chance to escape.  In return, [[Teldinath Dagon]] and all those who assisted would be granted power and immortality.

[[Teldinath Dagon]] freed [[Zezebazum]] from the magical protections he put in place before the summons, and the two of them began planning [[Azarad-Ji]]'s escape.

They discretely assembled willing followers and servants, as well as powerful mages gifted in the black arts.  During this time, the demon kept a very low profile, not wishing to publicly make his presence known for fear of banishment back to the stars.

[[Teldinath Dagon]] called his newfound cult &quot;The Holy Scourge&quot;, and began the ceremonies for the first phase of the plan he and [[Zezebazum]] masterminded.  Nonessential members of the cult were promised immortality and power, much to the same extent as Dagon.  The truth was that their souls were to be inhabited by [[Dathairä]], and their essence and life energies were to be consumed by the very demon that occupied their body.  The demon would gain access to knowledge and memories of its host, but the host's soul would be consumed and destroyed in the process.  Dagon called these creations [[Soulfiends]].

Ten [[Soulfiends]] were created, and they were each given the task of harvesting the essence from human souls.  This began what is known as [[The Demon Plague]].  A large pool of this energy was required for the ritual [[Teldinath Dagon]] and [[Zezebazum]] needed to perform to create the monster in which they would unleash upon the wall of [[Azarad-Ji]]'s prison.  The [[Soulfiends]] were set forth upon the world, leaving madness and terror in their wake.  Whole villages were laid to waste by the [[Soulfiends]] brutal theft of life energy.

The work of the [[Soulfiends]] was quick, and was not noticed until they began to harvest the energies of those living in the more populous regions of the realms.  Near what is now known as the [[The Dales]], two powerful mages wrested for control of supremacy.  [[Armondax]] the wizard of Brimstone and [[Mysara]], Lady of the Shadowy Depths felt the grips of the [[Soulfiends]] epidemic.  Each found towns within their circles of control occupied by the brainless husks of the townsfolk who once thrived there.

[[Armondax]] and [[Mysara]] both first suspected each other of the dastardly deeds inflicted upon the hapless townsfolk.  They both sought each other out to destroy each other for attacking harmless villagers.  Locked in a deadly magical battle, they both soon realized that neither of them was responsible.  It was at this moment that they became aware of the much more sinister plot brooding in the background.

They focused their efforts in stopping the [[Soulfiends]], their own thoughts of conquest and land were petty in comparison.  As much as they tried, it was a hard fought battle.  The [[Soulfiends]] were not easy combatants, and were not easy to find.

It was not until they were aided by [[Fazar]] the Wizard Knight, and [[Waywill]] Lifehealer that they had the combined power to stop the [[Soulfiends]].  [[Fazar]] and [[Waywill]] Lifehealer traveled from [[Zylok]] as soon as they heard of the evil magic being unleashed in the [[The Dales]].  [[Fazar]] and his army magically fortified towns not yet infected.  [[Waywill]] Lifehealer and a group of his healers tended to the town with the most casualties.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/the-shadow-lands/the-house-of-black-lanterns.jpg]]

The House Of Black Lanterns moves about [[The Shadow Lands]] on two legs that resemble that of a chicken.  It moves about seemingly to the whim of [[Yarol]], the proprietor - and appears where and when it is needed, as though whatever force moves it can sense this necessity.  Not even the inn's employees are certain the means of control [[Yarol]] has over the inn, and it is a frequent topic of discussion in the common room.

The inn offers shelter for travelers, as well as a place to share news and swap dark tales.  Raised centuries ago, the inn's ownership has changed hands so many times no one recalls who built the place or why.  The current proprietor [[Yarol]] claims to have won the place in a wager with the previous owner.  [[Yarol]] became the first person in centuries to take over the place non violently.  Although his claim is technically true, hee omits the detail that he has an uncanny talent for twisting fate in his favor.

Standing some three stories tall and fronted by an old bell tower, the windows of this building all face inward towards its courtyard; a single door leads outside.  A second building serves s a stable and barn, accessed through a set of doors.  Spread throughout the yard and swinging on black iron lampposts are the lanterns from which the inn takes its name.  Igniting on their own whenever the sun sets, the lanterns cast an eerie blue light throughout the courtyard.

Inside, a well trained staff sees to the needs of guests.  These folk are amiable to travelers, ready to answer questions about [[The Shadow Lands]] and provide basic services.  They hesitate only when questions about how they came to work at the inn, quickly finding excuses to change the subject or disengage.  For the equivalent of 5 silver you can get a room upstairs and a hot meal.

[[Yarol]] himself is a [[Shadar-Kai]], a race of [[Human]] accustomed to living within [[The Shadow Lands]].  He has a soft spot for newcomers to the realm, easy to spot from the confusion placed upon their faces.  Whether a lost soul or cosmic wanderer, [[Yarol]] temporarily hires them on as staff and sees they are cared for until they can find their way home.  Some decide to stay on permanently.

Key staff members include [[Kravdak]], an [[Orc]] warrior who stumbled into [[The Shadow Lands]] decades ago and stayed on as a bouncer, and [[NullaQuimo]] (&quot;little apple&quot; in [[Elvish]]), an [[Elf]] maiden who runs the head of house.</pre>

<div title="The Knights Of Deepwater" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202007072341" modified="202007080004" changecount="15">
<pre>The Knights Of Deepwater worship [[The Gods]] of [[Asha]] through service.  They strive to right wrongs, and defend the weak and unprotected.  Their base of operations is within the city walls of [[Deepwater]], close to the seat of power for [[The Divine Order]].  They protect and defend [[The Viridian Empire]].

!Code Of Honor
//Never break your word; Never defile [[The Gods]] or allow them to be defiled; Defend the weak and unprotected; Never raise your hand against a [[Priest]] or [[Knight]]; Never ignore an insult to yourself, the Knights, or anyone weaker than yourself; Take all pains and discomforts stoically and without apparent burden.//

!The Trials
Before becoming a [[Knight]], one must surpass four trials.  These tests harden and mold a person into what we know as a [[Knight]].  Each trial represents [[a God|The Gods]] of [[Asha]] and their teaching.  They are induced through many hours of meditation and physical manipulation of the body.  A master [[Knight]] must guide initiates through this process.
When a trial is successfully completed by an initiate, their spirit is enriched and their soul grows stronger.  Often this results in a brief divination with the prospective [[God|The Gods]].  The Knights strongly believe that what is seen and experienced during the trial is for the traveler, and the traveler alone.  No questions are asked as to what was witnessed.  One major rule is to never undertake a trial alone, always the path must be traveled with a companion.

* ''__The Trial Of Qualok__'' is the understanding that there is not an answer to every question.  Even [[Qualok]] does not possess enough years to fully understand the workings of the universe, which plagues him.  This trial should force the [[Knight]] to admit they do not understand, or they do not know.
* ''__The Trial Of Lucian__'' is one of tranquility and harmony.  To traverse this trial, one must attune one’s soul to [[The Gods]].  You must not allow your mind to cloud your soul, purify oneself with [[Lucian’s|Lucian]] wisdom.  This trial should force the [[Knight]] to help an enemy, or someone they hate and despise.
* ''__The Trial Of Kombar__'' is readiness.  Like [[Kombar]], one must prepare for the turmoil that all creatures must face.  A [[Knight]] never sees the end of this path, and continues to train until the day they become one with [[The Gods]].  This trial should test the limits of their battle experience.
* ''__The Trial Of Xander__''  tests the very limits of a [[Knight's|Knight]] training.  This is the most feared and brutal trial.  The pain and anguish caused by this test has broken many of individuals who have fallen from the Knighthood, unable to endure the sacrifice that [[Xander]] suffered.  This path should attempt to fatigue, confuse, and frighten the [[Knight]].</pre>

<pre>In [[The Dock Ward]] of the city of [[Zylok]] sits a strange shop that stands out from the others.  It has a deep purple facade, and in its window is a desiccated head of a [[Dathairä]].  A cloud of lavender scented purple smoke trails out of the shop door as one walks inside.  Every wall is painted purple, and every dusty knickknack on the shelves is dyed a deep violet.  The proprietor, a hairless [[Bairn]] who calls himself [[Nehga]] is fond of sitting cross legged on top of the counter smoking a pipe that is responsible for the lavender smoke.  He is hairless and quite old, wearing a plum colored robe.  His cheeks and forehead are decorated with nine painted eyes.

The desiccated [[Dathairä]] head is indeed real.  [[Nehga]] refers to it by name, which is also [[Nehga]] - but he is clear to point out the name is just coincidence.

<pre>&quot;The Lifting&quot; is the name given to the event in 1021 [[AAP]] when the cities of [[Caldoria]] were raised from the bottom of the ocean.  The seven cities of [[Caldoria]] were protected from the crushing depths of the ocean from a magical dome.  This dome served as protection, but was beginning to deteriorate.  In 142 AAP the first breach was discovered.  A small hole that temporarily formed in the dome causing cold seawater to pour forth - it luckily closed on its own accord.  The [[Dragonborn Elders]], in order to calm the population suggested this was natural and no cause for alarm.  This was the prevailing belief for hundreds of years.  In 1001 [[AAP]], one [[Dragonborn]] named [[Xyvs]] began to study the breaches.  His analysis caused him to determine the breaches were increasing in both frequency and magnitude.  [[Xyvs]] calculated this would cause flooding and lead to the extinction of his society.  The [[Dragonborn Elders]] ignored him, thinking him foolish; and the general population continued to believe the breaches to be part of the natural cycle designed by its creators - bringing new air, water and life.

In 1021 [[AAP]] [[The Grey Companions]] on the maiden voyage of [[The Airship Triumph]] inadvertently discovered one of these breaches, when their ship was pulled down into a giant whirlpool.  To many [[Dragonborn]], their very existence proved the surface of [[Asha]] was hospitable and the fallibility of the [[Dragonborn Elders]].

[[Kurga The Black]] was [[The Speaker Of The Council Of Elders|The Council Of Elders]], and had just recently killed the other [[Elders|Dragonborn Elders]] to slowly gain more power and control; the slow rot of [[Desecration]] reaching even under the ocean.  He was influenced by the corruption of [[Blood Magic]], and contact with [[Dathairä]].</pre>

<pre>The Memoirs Of Hagen Hairfoot is an autobiographical [[book|Books and Literature]] written by [[Hagen Hairfoot]], a [[Bairn]] [[Bard]].  He was an adventurer of some renown who lived in the city of [[Zylok]] during the formation of [[The Viridian Empire]]. 

His memoirs are composed across multiple volumes, each containing tall tales that make for exciting reading.  He lived during the [[Azutan Nagyos]] and played a roll alongside the founders of [[The Athenaeum]] and [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].  He was a good friend to [[Waywill]], [[Armondax]], [[Mysara]], and [[Fazar]] - and sang of their greatness and contribution.

Some of his most fanciful tales in the books include [[Mysara]] traveling [[The Planes Of Existence]] through [[The Mirror Of Resplendence]] made of liquefied [[Mana]], [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]] raising [[The Athenaeum]] from dirt using the power of [[Magic]], and tales of [[Hagen Hairfoot]] and how he walked the length of [[The Viridian Empire]] four times over.

<pre>The Mummers are led by whomever bears the title of [[The Salt King]].  [[The Salt King]] rules from The Mummer's stronghold of [[Grimstone]], located within [[The Risen Reef]] off of the eastern coast of [[Amon]].  As the de facto ruler of The Mummers, [[The Salt King]] commands the numerous pirates and ships - seeing that their basic system of law and order is maintained.  In the event of a major dispute between two or more Mummers pertaining to the breaking of the law, their case is brought before [[The Salt King]] at which point the parties argue their cases and [[The Salt King]] makes judgement accordingly.  If one party is found to be at fault, depending on the severity of the offense, the offending party may be sentenced to pay some form of restitution to the offending party or may even be put to death if [[The Salt King]] deems it suitable.

!The Code Of The Mummers
* ''The Code Of Civility'' - no Mummer shall strike another aboard their ship or upon the soil of [[Grimstone]]; every dispute is settled by duel on the command of the quartermaster.  He who draws first blood shall be declared the victor.
* ''The Rite Of Parlay'' - when invoking this right, one has temporary protection from harm until granted an audience with the enemy captain.  Parley is not considered concluded until said captive and captain have completed negotiations.
* ''The Honor of the Escudo'' - the [[Escudo]] is a steel coin minted by The Mummers.  It is less of a form of currency and more of a form of respect, the currency of relationships.
* ''The Don't Hunt Our Own'' - The Mummers don't steal from one another.  Knowingly targeting other pirate ships is forbidden.  Respect your fellows in all accounts.
* ''Mercy To Those Who Ask'' - killing a surrendered enemy is not allowed.  The mercy of The Mummers shall not be overlooked.
* ''No Games Of Chance'' - no Mummer shall game for money; either with dice or cards
* ''Sharing of the spoils'' - all crew of a vessel share equally in the plunder.  The captain and first mate are entitled to double share, and one share is kept for [[The Salt King]].  Whomever spotted the ship/plunder gets first pick.

<pre>The Old Gods are a pantheon of utterly alien, unfathomably ancient, poorly understood god-like beings that exist outside of reality itself; outside of the concepts of faith and souls.  Little is known about them, other than they are ancient and predate [[The Gods]] and thus the concept of mortality itself.  They exist in [[The Abyss]] outside of the concepts of time and reality, possessing an alien intelligence that have them perceive [[The Material Plane]] in such an inscrutable way that they cannot recognize their own actions as evil.

!Cults and Worship
The Old Gods do not demand or require servitude.  However, those that follow them (known as [[Warlocks|Warlock]]) are able to draw on immense magical power.  While there exist [[Warlocks|Warlock]] who attempt to use the power of The Old Gods for good, the mortal mind is almost always driven insane by a prolonged connection with such an alien intelligence.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/organizations/the-old-republic.jpg]]
The Old Republic was the nearly 2,000 year long period of [[Kellos]] beginning with the deposing of [[Tarmon Gellius II]], known as &quot;The Frail King&quot; of [[Kellos]] in 1775 [[IO]] and ending with [[Cyril Viridian]] declaring himself [[Emperor]] in 1 [[AAP]].  

During the reign of [[Tarmon Gellius II]], the politics of [[Kellos]] was fragmented into rival regions and pressured by [[The Kellish Wars]].  The king was deposed and the republic formed to unite the regions under a single banner and brace itself for war.  In these early days the senate was politically weak, a place for petty squabbles.  Towards the end of the republic, the senate had reached the apex of its political might.
 
Positions in the Old Republic

Consul - ruled over the senate
censor - census, morality &amp; finances
magistrate
questor - magistrate with financial duties
praetor - general of armies
tribune - speak/act on behalf of groups (eg guilds, soldiers, etc)
aedile - maintain buildings &amp; oversee festivals
prefect - police


assembly, decrees

Old republic used gladiatorial combat for death sentences, still in effect in [[The Green Sea]] - this was a tradition from [[Amon]]</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/kellish-language.jpg]]
The Old Tongue is a language that was spoken by [[The First Men]] of [[Kellos]], known as [[Kells|Kell]].  Fragments remain in common use among those living in [[The Northlands]] of [[The Viridian Empire]], and it is in full use among the [[northern barbarian tribes|Kell]] that still practice the nomadic culture of their ancestors.  The Old Tongue has no written form, all histories and lineage’s of the [[Kell]] are passed through oral traditions.

[[Kells|Kell]] are very patriotic, and prize their language and beliefs.  Therefore even [[Kells|Kell]] born outside of the northern plains learn to speak Kellish at an early age.

!Guide To Pronunciation
Pronounce U “oo” as in boot, A “ah” as in father, I “ee” as in marine.  The letters Q and X do not exist in the Kellish language. Consonants mirror their English equivalents, with the exception of GY.  GY is pronounced “dee” as in medium.

Due to the practical lifestyle the [[Kells|Kell]] are forced to live on the harsh [[northern plains|NorthernPlains]], their language is also practical.  Nouns and Verbs for luxurious or items not directly related to survival or warfare often do not exist in the Kellish language.

!Common Sayings and Phrases
Halal so kovet – “our fates converge” used as a greeting
Ritus borozag – Rite of passage: receiving the clan naming
Tronra lepes – the ceremony for becoming chief of a clan
Halal dicsaret – may your fate be kind – used to say ‘goodbye’

They are currently lead by [[Vaerana]], a no nonsense tough as nails woman who is greatly respected by the criminal underbelly of the city.  The guild specializes in the black market, pickpocket operations and cat burglar activities, leaving behind a purple mask that they affix to the wall with a bodkin.

Due to [[Brand]] being a major trading hub, the Masks specialize in moving black market and contraband goods throughout the realms.  [[Riszan Erodi]] is the proprietor of [[The Vault]], a shop of relics, antiques, and curios.  While he is a businessman and not a formal member of The Purple Masks, he is one of their most notable fences due to his many contacts in and out of [[Brand]].

The Masks work hard to remain discrete.  Random theft is not their style, as it would enrage [[Lord Jakus Saxon|Jakus Saxon]].  In fact, [[Vaerana]] sees that petty theft is kept to a minimum - forcing upstart criminals to join the Masks or leave her city.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/gods/the-remnant.jpg]]
In a time long past and forgotten within [[The Third Age]], a powerful [[Mage|Magic]] known as [[The Whispered One]] attempted to ascend to godhood by conducting [[The Ritual Of Seeding]].  While born as a mortal [[Human]] of an untouchable caste in what is now modern day [[Amon]], he obtained a mastery of [[Blood Magic]] unlike any mortal had seen before.  His power grew, amassing a [[terrible empire|The Vaecnan Dynasty]] that he ruled over for 1,000 years.  His armies laid siege to the surrounding countryside and he was known as [[The Whispered One]], slaughtering the [[Draugaira Elves|Draugaira]] native to the continent.  He stacked their heads as trophies, as he slaughtered them for his magical experiments.  His lust for power knew no bounds, and he sought to gain the power of a [[god|The Gods]].  [[The Whispered One]] surrounded himself with a cult of fanatical worshipers to protect him during his ritual, yet his apotheosis was shattered by those who wanted to bring his evil to an end.  With The Whispered One destroyed, his followers seemingly vanished from the world.

In anticipation of the ritual's possible failure, [[The Whispered One]] left instructions with his most devoted, allowing for the possibility of his rebirth.  The remains of the cult dubbed themselves The Remnant and began laying the groundwork for The Whispered One's eventual return.  With each passing generation, his will grows ever stronger.  Their symbol is that of a lidless eye on the palm of a skeletal hand.

!Goals
Following the instructions he left behind, The Remnant seeks to slowly infiltrate and indoctrinate elements of society to prepare for the next state in [[The Whispered One's|The Whispered One]] plot.  Each separate sect of the cult is named as a part of his body, and acts independently  to pursue their assigned tasks.  These sub-factions are called The Eyes, The Voice, The Blood, The Hand, and The Heart.  Each splinter cult is tasked with infiltrating and corrupting a respective societal core, and it's said that when the time for their dark master's return is nigh, they shall rejoin as one for the ritual.

The members of The Remnant are largely unknown, and wish to remain so.  Those who are aware of their presence are either members, or have uncovered their insidious existence and seek to stamp it out whenever it may appear.  Thus, there are rarely any alliances made by or with the Remnant.

The Second Age was an age of turmoil and strife.  [[Humanity|Human]] was nearly extinguished as the inter-dimensional tear created by [[The First Desecration]] belched forth creatures and powers hitherto unseen by mortal eyes.

!The Cataclysm
The sheer magnitude of the energies unleashed in [[The First Desecration]] was enough to fray the boundaries holding back the elemental chaos, spilling unbridled destruction into the world.  It reduced cities to ash and devastated [[Humanity|Human]] until there was a scant few survivors left hanging on to a thread of existence.  The landscape became a wasteland, where the eternal battle between [[The Gods]] and [[Azarad-Ji]] was fought once again.  After a prolonged conflict, [[The Gods]] stood victorious once again - and knew that if they kept [[The Divine Gate]] open, the prison of [[Azarad-Ji]] would remain imperfect and temporary.  Thus, in hopes of ensuring such a ruin would never befall [[Asha]] again, they left [[Asha]] never to return.

!The Collapse
All of the creatures and monstrosities that were born from [[The First Desecration]] began to make a foothold in [[Asha]].  The turmoil on [[Asha]] attracted many abominations.  The [[Dragons|Dragon]] came from an unknown region, adding to the chaos.  The [[Dathairä]] [[Vergadain]] aided the [[Primordials|Primordial]] to break through from [[The Elemental Planes]], and they roamed free to spread destruction and devastation.

!The Divine War
The battle between [[The Gods]] and [[Azarad-Ji]] was fought simultaneously across multiple [[Planes Of Existence|The Planes Of Existence]].  [[Asha]] was not spared from the carnage, and the children of [[Azarad-Ji]], the [[Dathairä]] battled fiercely with the [[AstraKashira]].  The final battle was fought on [[Asha]] between a horde of [[Dathairä]] and the [[AstraKashira]] army known as [[The Radiant Guard]].  The final blow was struck by [[ImoMahtara]] who slaughtered [[Drelmor]] with [[The Spire Of Planes]] - a staff constructed from the multiple [[Planes Of Existence|The Planes Of Existence]].  Both [[ImoMahtara]] and [[Drelmor]] were destroyed outright, vaporized into oblivion by the power of the artifact.  The shock wave from the impact shattered [[The Spire Of Planes]], disintegrated [[Drelmor]] for eternity, and created a [[Dead Magic Zone]] which still lasts to this day known as [[The Boneyard]] in southern [[Kellos]].  The battle was known as [[The Night Of Tears]].

!The Second Desecration
[[The Second Desecration]] was the closure of [[The Cataclysm]].  The prison in which [[Azarad-Ji]] was bound, the sun, was dying; and [[The Gods]] could only repair it for eternity by closing themselves off from [[Asha]] all together and closing [[The Divine Gate]].  [[Asha's|Asha]] dying sun was an imperfect prison, and after the prolonged battle between [[The Gods]] and [[Azarad-Ji]] they moved him to a much more secure location - outside of the [[Material Plane]].

!The Elves And Dwarves
After the wars, [[Kombar]] and [[Lucian]] left their children upon [[Asha]] to care for and protect it, in respect for their lost sister [[Valouria]].  There was much work to do, for [[Asha]] needed much care and attention to reach its previous glory.

!The Gafflinz
One race that spilled forth from [[The Cataclysm]] was the [[Gafflinz]], who were ripped from an unknown dimension.  Their physiology made them immune to many of the effects of [[The Cataclysm]] and they began seeking a way home.  Their attempts to pierce into their lost home dimension created [[The Wilds]]; where they decided to reside away from the strangeness of [[Asha]].

<pre>The Shadow Lands, also known as [[The Shadowfell]] is the name of another dimension and plane of existence in [[Asha]].  It is a dark dimension of desolate rocky wasteland, covered in shadows.  Few adventure here and return to tell the tale, as it is a realm filled with dangerous creatures.  The first [[Human]] to explore The Shadow Lands and document its existence was [[Mysara]], Lady of Shadowy Depths.

Native to this realm are the [[Barguul]], or &quot;shadows&quot; in [[Black Speech]].  They are evil entities that can inhabit a host body and possess and control it.  Sensing life, they seek out those who enter The Shadow Lands, making them one of the most dangerous creatures to visitors.  The [[Displacer Beast]] and [[Shadow Dragon]] are also beasts found within the realm.  A race of humanoids known as [[Shadar-Kai]] also reside here.

[[The Grey Companions]] ventured into this dimension when a portal was forced open in the village of [[Abermaw]].  Many of [[The Grey Companions]] perished in an ambush in attempt to close the portal.  [[Sanders]] stayed behind to help the young mage [[Erik Doorhaus]] close the portal from both sides.

<pre>The Spire Of Planes was an artifact wielded by the [[AstraKashira]] [[ImoMahtara]] in the battle that ended [[The Second Age]] known as [[The Night Of Tears]].  The staff was forged by [[Kombar]] using materials gathered across seven of [[The Planes Of Existence]].  To bind the forging, a great sacrifice was made - [[Xander]] gave freely his own sight, knowing that this was the final hope for imprisoning [[Azarad-Ji]] once more.

As [[Xander]] would no longer be able to wield it in battle himself, he gave it to [[Lucian]] who met [[Azarad-Ji]] and his forces on [[Asha]] itself.  [[Lucian]] wielded it in his stead, at the vanguard of an army of her [[AstraKashira]] clad in gleaming golden armor.  The forces of darkness were led by [[Drelmor]], standing at the side of [[Azarad-Ji]] himself.  The battle raged for years in mortal time, a near stalemate until [[Lucian]] was able to strike [[Azarad-Ji]] with a piercing blow from the Spire.  She seized the opportunity to begin a deadly struggle to subdue [[Azarad-Ji]].  [[Drelmor]] rushed to [[Azarad-Ji's|Azarad-Ji]] aid, striking [[Lucian]] in a near fatal blow - causing her to drop the staff.

A brave [[AstraKashira]] foot soldier named [[ImoMahtara]] leaped from the fray, gliding towards [[Lucian]] to protect her.  Bloodied from battle, [[ImoMahtara]] blocked [[Drelmor's|Drelmor]] attack with her shield - then grasped for The Spire Of Planes within the dirt, stabbing it at [[Drelmor]].  The impact sent a shockwave large enough to bring all of the armies to their knees.  A bright light burst from the Spire, and vaporized [[Drelmor]], the prized son of [[Azarad-Ji]].  The rod shattered, splintering into seven parts.  Thus ending the battle, and [[The Second Age]].

The Great Sylvan Empire was a large and vast civilization very much unlike that of modern day [[Elves|Elf]].  This empire was the precursor of the [[Forana'loloKashira]], a time in which the [[Elves|Elf]] lived in large stone cities and ruled over one another in strict governmental fashion.  The [[Elves|Elf]] lived under their magnificent empire for nearly 6,000 years between 8022 [[IO]] and 2127 [[IO]], until a horror befell their civilization at its greatest peak.  [[Azarad-Ji]] and his [[Dathairä]] tempted and tainted the [[Elves|Elf]] into what the [[Elves|Elf]] call [[The Third Desecration]].

When the [[Kiragä|Kiraga]] had been forced into hiding and the [[Dathairä]] pushed back into the wild lands, many thousands were dead.  But those [[Varigellë|Varigelle]] that survived had no kingdom to return to.  Some did go to the forests and joined the [[Elves|Elf]] that became the [[Forana'loloKashira]].  Most found no comfort in the carefree woodland dwellings, dinging that war was all they remembered.  The restless ones gathered together in the plains and formed the first tribe of the [[Variona'Sha]].  This clan grew and continued keeping the [[Varigellë Code Of Honor]] as their highest law.  The clan split and their culture spread throughout the realm.

The Third Age was an age of enlightenment and prosperity.  While [[Humanity|Human]], [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] and [[Elven|Elf]] civilizations flourished, the Age was dominated by the [[Elves|Elf]] - which is why this Age is known as The Age Of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  

!The Sylvan Empire
The [[Elven|Elf]] civilization thrived and reached a level of enlightenment and prosperity unseen in previous Ages.  They created an [[Empire|The Sylvan Empire]] that spanned multiple continents, powered by magic lost to present day magicians.  [[The Sylvan Empire]] had access to domains of magic such as [[Travelling]], [[Time Manipulation]], and [[Enchantment]].  Prior to [[The Third Desecration]], the [[Elves|Elf]] experimented with [[Foretelling]] - resulting in the foretelling of the fall of [[The Sylvan Empire]] and the [[BahaUlla Prophecy]].  Their lust for power corrupted and blinded them, causing [[The Third Desecration]].

!The Rise Of Ammenon
On the continent now known as [[Amon]], the rise of [[Human]] colonies vexed the [[Draugaira Elves|Draugaira]].  Forests that had stood for centuries fell under the axes of creatures who lived only a scant few decades.  These tensions did not rise to war, but the [[Humans|Human]] gnawed at peace like termites.

This first [[Human]] civilization of The Third Age was brutal and cruel, built by a handful of self-entitled nobles who stacked the laws and structure in their favor.  Slavery, brutality, and corruption spread through the region.  A young man named [[Ammenon]], born from an underprivileged class, was a victim of this savagery - and as such began seeking revenge.  He eventually assumed a mastery of [[Blood Magic]] achieved by no mortal since.  Building a terrible army, he conquered the [[Human]] lands of [[Amon]] and then with intense fervor turned his attention on the ashen skin [[Draugaira]] who he slaughtered by the thousands in order to achieve immortality an eventually seek to claim his own godhood.  He was thwarted, and is fabled now only as [[The Whispered One]] with a small number of cultists (known as [[The Remnant]]) that seek to bring him back.

!The Third Desecration
[[The Third Desecration]] began from within [[The Sylvan Empire]], when the [[Dathairä]] [[Zezebazum]] used the [[Elven|Elf]] hubris to corrupt the [[Kiraga]] and tear apart [[The Sylvan Empire]] from the inside.  The [[Elf]] [[Raime Wesewierë]] was able to influence and thwart [[Zezebazum]] and the [[Kiraga]] such that the impact was contained to the [[Elves|Elf]] rather than sending [[Asha]] into another dark age.</pre>

The [[Variona'Sha]] tell the fragments they have of the story, such that history will not be repeated, and [[Raime Wesewierë]]'s legacy will not go unremembered.  It accounts a tale of fallen [[Elves|Elf]] known as [[Kiraga]] who were corrupted by the demon [[Zezebazum]].

<pre>In the year 1008 [[AAP]], several massive [[Orc]] hordes came north from across the water to attack the southern shores of [[The Viridian Empire]].  The [[Orcs|Orc]] nearly crippled the [[Human]] towns along [[The Golden Shores]] and occupied the city of [[Rivenhold]].

<pre>[&gt;img[images/locations/westron-wall.jpg]]
The Westron Wall is the largest stone fortification in the realms.  It stretches from [[Lake Acharutha]] to the southern mountain ranges.  Built nearly 3,000 years ago in the year 1776 [[IO]] to push [[barbarians|Kell]] away from the newly settled areas within what is now [[The Green Sea]] in what was known as [[The Kellish Wars]].

The wall began as a simple dirt fortification, and reinforced with stone up to 1768 [[IO]] when the wars ended.  In modern times, the wall remains a relic of times passed.  The area beyond the wall is known as [[The Northlands]], and many of the people that dwell there still retain the spirit and bloodline of the original [[barbarians|Kell]], although they are free citizens of [[The Viridian Empire]].  In the far north, there still remain a small group of nomadic people whose practices still mirror those of their ancient ancestors.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/ammenon/the-whispered-one.jpg]]
The Whispered One, has many names and titles; The Maimed God, The Dying King, The Lord Of The Rotting Tower, The Undying.  He was a [[Human]] of [[The Third Age]] named [[Ammenon]] who rose to prominence and created [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]] in modern day [[Amon]].  His capital and home was in the now lost city of [[Tar Barog]].

This first [[Human]] civilization of [[The Third Age]] was brutal and cruel, built by a handful of self-entitled nobles who stacked the laws and structure in their favor.  Slavery, brutality, and corruption spread through the region.  A young man named [[Ammenon]], born in 3253 [[IO]] to an underprivileged class, was a victim of this savagry - and as such began seeking revenge.  He eventually assumed a mastery of [[Blood Magic]] achieved by no mortal since.  Building a terrible army, he conquered the [[Human]] lands of what is now [[Amon]] and formed [[The Vaecnan Dynasty]].

With an intense fervor, he turned his attention on the ashen skin [[Draugaira]] who he slaughtered by the thousands in order to achieve immortality and eventually seek to claim his own godhood.  The [[Draugaira]] put up a valiant fight, but were quickly overwhelmed by the ferocity of The Whispered One's undead forces.  They made their final stand in the city of [[Esserosse]] (&quot;The Mist Palace&quot; in [[Elvish]]) - where the [[AstraKashira]] [[Shalekasha]] came to their aid but was slain and corrupted by The Whispered One.  All hope lost, the [[Draugaira]] faded into history.

He was finally thwarted by the prophet [[Poulcheria]], and is fabled now only as The Whispered One with a small number of cultists (known as [[The Remnant]]) that seek to bring him back.

<pre>A pocket dimension created by the [[Gafflinz]] after [[The Second Desecration]].  The Wilds are [[Mana]] dead, meaning no magic items or spells work within this realm.  It is completely dark, only creatures with [[Dark Vision]] or illumination can see effectively.  Imagine a great empty void, with platforms connected by paths and stairways.  Gravity in this dimension is fickle and objective, always pointing &quot;down&quot; however stairways, paths and platforms are in such a way that travelers will find themselves walking up walls or on stairways that hang them above the spiraling maze of platforms.

The [[Gafflinz]] created this dimension in an attempt to return to their original plane of existence.  Those trapped on [[Asha]] live secretly deep within the wilds in massive technological cities.  There are wayposts scattered throughout the dimension that the [[Gafflinz]] can use to direct themselves to known gateways and cities, however they are written in a cypher that is near impossible for those who are not a [[Gafflinz]] to decipher.

Gateways are metal monstrosities of clockwork gears and metal.  Opening the gateway requires the deft skill of a 12 fingered creature, triggering small hidden buttons and switches deep in the recesses of the seemingly carved doorway.</pre>

The arcane symbols needed to [[Teleport|Teleportation]] are inlaid into the floor with colorful mosaic tiles.  The waystation is smaller in size in relation to it's cousins spread across [[Asha]], but is magnificent in that it houses within it's central chamber statues of the founders of [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]]: [[Waywill]], [[Armondax]], [[Mysara]], and [[Fazar]].  The statues are 25 feet tall, with their heads stretching to the ceiling.  Each statues is imbued with magical energy making them appear to be alive.  [[Waywill's|Waywill]] statue is of a wizened old man with a beard, his arms held out in open palms, face obscured by a cloak.  Illusory magic makes his eyes burn and flicker under his hood.  The statue of [[Mysara]] is of a woman with long hair with an open book in one hand, mystical energy engulfing the other.  A ferret hangs around her neck.  Her hair flickers between red and stone grey - and waves in a false breeze.  [[Fazar]] strikes an imposing figure - bald and muscular.  His vest bares his arms that are decorated with tattoos running down their length.  He holds two scimitars which he has crossed in front of his body.  His tattoos and swords glow faintly blue.  The final statue is of [[Armondax]] with a neatly trimmed beard and mustache and a wry smile.  His elaborate and ornate cape and waistcoat are emblazoned with dragons.  His left hand is on a wand pointing down at his side, his right hand has flames on his index finger which he has pointing up.  His eyes appear to follow you, his smile widening.

Before entering the city, travelers are asked:

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Athenaeum/thog-stoneheart/thog-stoneheart.jpg]]

Thog Stoneheart (c 980 [[AAP]] - 1025 [[AAP]]) was the [[Dean]] of the [[Lower School]] of [[The Athenaeum]] and professor of [[Conjuration]] [[Magic]].  He was a [[Goliath]] from the northern reaches of [[Kellos]], hailing from beyond the civilized lands.  He was muscular and strong, and had tribal tattoos along his head and chest.  His tattoos represent significant moments in both his and his tribe's history.  As a child, his tribe taught him the ways of the [[Barbarian]], as he follows the [[Primal Path]] of the [[Ancestral Guardian]].  This allows his ancestors to assist him in battle.

Thog is the son of [[Vamir Stoneheart]], who was the tribal leader.  When Vamir passed away peacefully, a new tribal leader was required.  Every [[Barbarian]] who follows the [[Primal Path]] of the [[Ancestral Guardian]] has an ancestor who watches over them.  [[Vamir Stoneheart]] began to watch over Thog, making him a natural choice to lead the tribe.  However, Thog was bested by his brother [[Kovak Stoneheart]] and forced to leave the tribe in exile.  [[The Sky Forged Maul]], a large hammer made by the tribe's ancestors from a meteor, and symbol of leadership, passed to [[Kovak Stoneheart]].  While Thog is unaware, [[Kovak Stoneheart]] poisoned his own father, and bested Thog using trickery and deceit (something that is dishonorable in the tribes eyes).

In exile, Thog found his way to the city of [[Kohor]] - where he worked to reinvent himself.  There he learned [[Wizardry]], which he took to easily.  His [[Familiar]] was a [[Hawk]] named [[Omen]].

Thog was killed protecting [[Nester Arkwood]] from an attack on [[The Athenaeum]] in 1025 [[AAP]] by [[Harmost Xawn]] and [[Penelope Kensington]] in an attempt to bring about the resurrection of [[The Whispered One]].  This event is known as [[The Black Night]].

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/tiefling.jpg]]

Those who bear the mark of [[Baator]] are first met with mistrust, then curiosity - and in the more rural areas of [[Asha]], fear.  They often suffer insults, or worse violence due to a pact that may have been struck generations ago with [[Dathairä]] - infusing their infernal essence into their bloodline.  The Tiefling carry to physical appearance of this ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children's children will always be held accountable.

!Infernal Bloodline
Tiefling's are derived from the joining of [[Human]] and [[Dathairä]] bloodlines.  While they still appear [[Human]], the infernal heritage is clearly visible.  These traits manifest in a variety of shapes and ways; horns, tails, canine teeth, solid colored eyes, and abhorrent skin tones.

!Self Reliant and Suspicious
Tiefling's are a minority in [[Asha]], and are mostly found within [[Human]] cities or towns; often in the roughest quarters of those places.  Tiefling's have no place to call their own, unfit for [[Baator]], and likewise untrusted among the civilized [[Races]].  Tieflings must be strong to survive the onslaught they suffer from mistrust and degradation, and can be slow to trust and make new friends.

|''Hellish Resistance:'' Resistance to fire damage.|
|''Infernal Legacy:'' Tieflings have the //Thaumaturgy// cantrip.  At 3rd level they can cast //Hellish Rebuke// as a 2nd level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when they finish a long rest.

The caster can take on the appearance and form - including clothing and equipment - of a corporeal humanoid that is freshly dead.  The caster assumes the form of the creature as it looked when it lived.  The caster must eat the flesh of the corpse whose form is to be assumed as they cast the spell.
Once the spell is complete, the caster can assume the new likeness at will.  By changing to this new form, the caster's body can undergo a limited physical transmutation, including adding or subtracting one or two limbs, and his weight can be changed up to double.  If the form selected has wings, the caster can fly at a speed of 30 feet wit poor maneuverability.  If the form has gills, they can breather underwater.  The caster cannot assume the likeness of something that is a different size than they are.
The caster's attack bonuses, natural armor bonus, and saves do not change.  The spell does not confer special abilities, attack forms, defenses, ability scores, or mannerisms of the chosen form.  If the caster takes damage or dies, they automatically revert to their normal form and lose the ability to transform into the target forever.  The caster can also take a standard action to voluntarily assume their normal form.
If the caster uses this ritual to create a disguise, they are at a +10 bonus on their Disguise check.
The caster takes 2d6 points of damage when the spell is completed.

!Despoil
|//''Required Components:'' The corpse of a freshly dead or preserved (still bloody) sentient creature.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 minute|
|''Range:'' Touch|
|''Area:'' 100 ft/level radius|
|''Duration:'' Permanent|
The caster blights and corrupts a vast area of land.  Plants with 1 HD or less shrivel and die, and the ground cannot support such plant life ever again.  All other living things in the area (minus the caster) make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 12 and take 5d6 necrotic damage on a failure, and half on a success.

!Evil Eye
|//''Required Components:'' A fresh or preserved (still bloody) eye from a creature.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 action|
|''Range:'' 25 ft + 5ft / 2 levels|
|''Duration:'' See text|
The caster consumes the eye of a creature, and focuses malevolent wishes through their gaze and curses someone with bad luck.  On a failed Wisdom save of a DC 15, the subject rolls at disadvantage for any die roll until the next sunrise, the spell is dismissed by the caster, a remove curse is cast upon the subject, or when the caster takes at least 1 point of damage from the subject. 

!Eyes Of Draizon
|//''Required Components:'' A fresh pair of eyes, [[The Milk Of Draizon]].//|
|''Casting Time:'' 12 hours|
|''Range:'' Touch|
|''Duration:'' See text|
This ritual requires a fresh pair of eyes, prepared in a blood and salt solution for 12 hours.  The caster imbues the eyes with the power of [[Draizon]], then places them into a willing subject.  It is possible for the eyes to be those of the subject that were removed at the start of the ritual.  The new eyes grant advantage on Investigation, and Perception checks - and the visual abilities of the creature that owned them (e.g. Darkvision, Blindsight, Passive Perception).  The subject must make a Constitution saving throw upon receiving the new eyes with a DC of 10 else their body rejects the eyes.

!Forbidden Speech
|//''Required Components:'' The tongue of a creature who could speak.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 minute|
|''Range:'' Touch|
|''Duration:'' Permanent|
The caster consumes a tongue of a creature who once could speak and the target makes a DC 15 Wisdom save.  On a failure, it is impossible for a single creature to speak about a single topic.  The topic should be as narrow as possible for the spell to work properly.  An appropriate topic might be events that occurred while the creature was in captivity, the whereabouts and names of tormentors, the secret location of a hidden treasure, the password into a guarded compound, the command word for a magic item, or the explanation behind some major occurrences.  Invalid topics include verbal components of spells, a creature's whole life history, or anything too broad for a reasonable definition of a single topic.  Whether a topic is too broad is up to the DM, who can double the damage if a caster persists in attempting an invalid topic.
The affected creature cannot communicate regarding the topic in any way.  Speech becomes gibberish, writing is reduced to an indecipherable scrawl, gestures are impossible, and even telepathy (including detect thoughts) is scrambled.  The creature has not forgotten the information, however, and it can be a maddening occurrence for the creature to be unable to communicate information that might be of life and death importance to friends and allies.
After the casting, the caster takes 1d6 damage.

!Liquid Pain
|//''Required Components:'' A living creature in great pain.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 24 hours|
|''Range:'' Touch|
|''Duration:'' Permanent|
Over the course of 24 hours, the caster takes a subject already in great pain (wracked with disease, the victim of torture, or dying of a wound) and captures its pain in liquid form into a jar or vial.  The physical manifestation of their agony can be used as a material component in other rituals.

!Slow Consumption
|//''Required Components:'' A living creature.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 10 minutes|
|''Range:'' Touch|
|''Duration:'' Permanent|
The caster absorbs the life force and physical form from a living subject and uses it for themselves.  The victim must be rendered helpless to cast this spell upon them.  For that day, the caster heals at twice the normal natural rate and does not need to eat.  The subject, on the other hand, does not heal naturally that day, and takes 1 point of damage.  As long as the caster touches the subject once per day, they gain the benefits and the subject takes the damage.  If the caster does not touch the subject within 24 hours of the last tie they touched, the spell ends.
Villians often use this spell on prisoners who are sometimes sustain by lesser restoration spells so they can serve for years as evil sustenance.

!Steal Life
|//''Required Components:'' A living sentient being.//|
|''Casting Time:'' 1 minute|
|''Range:'' Touch|
|''Duration:'' Concentration|
The caster taps into the life force of a subject and drains it away, adding it to their own.  Each round the caster concentrates, they deal 1 point of ability score drain to the subject if they fail a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 12.  Although the caster can choose which ability score to drain, they must choose a different ability score to drain in  each round and cannot chose a score already drained until they have drained all the others equally, at which point the process starts over.  Thus, if the caster drains 1 point of Strength, they must choose another ability in the next round and cannot choose Strength again until they have drained 1 point each of Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.  Then, the caster can drain a second point, but not a third until they have drained a second point front all of the other ability scores.
The subject withers and shrivels as the caster drains its ability scores.  When the subject's Constitution score reaches 0, the subject becomes a horrid, dry husk and cannot be further drained.  If the caster dies while concentrating on this spell, all of the subject's lost ability score points are immediately regained.
If the caster casts this spell on the night of a full moon, they become effectively one week younger for every point they drain.  Their age reduces, but memories and abilities acquired during that week are not lost.  Otherwise, the subject takes the ability score d rain, but the caster gains nothing.</pre>

<div title="Travelling" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="201507262245" modified="201507262245" changecount="2">
<pre>Traveling is the magic means of creating holes in reality in order to create one-way shortcuts between points in time, space and [[Dimensions]].  A magical gateway can take nearly any shape or color, but are often rectangular in shape (roughly the shape of a doorway).  As long as the gate is large enough, an object or willing being need only step into it to be transported.  Beings with Magic Resistance lower the effective skill of the gate's creator accordingly, possibly preventing the gate from working for them (see p M13).  If an unwilling (or unwitting) person sticks a hand into the gate, removing it can be difficult; roll a Regular Contest between the victim's ST and the caster's effective skill, each turn of effort costing the victim a point of fatigue.  If the victim fails the contest, his only choices are to stay stuck in the gateway or to pass through...

If the gate is not large enough, it will feel like an impenetrable wall.  Gates are impervious to physical attacks and to most magic.  They are also opaque to light and non-particulate radiation in general.  Spells other than Information ones may be cast through a gate,at the usual penalty for casting blindly (unless Scry Gate is used).  An Area spell does not &quot;spill through&quot; an open gate, but matter created by such a spell may.

To tell where a gate leads, without stepping through it, is difficult; a successful Analyze Magic will only reveal the //nature// of the gate: distance, time or universe/plane (or combination).  A critical success will reveal the gate's destination, its opening or closing clauses,m whether several gates share the same spot, etc.  The Scry Gate spell can also be used to gain clues as to a portal's &quot;connection point&quot;.

Gates may be the subject of many spells, but the GM should keep in mind that they are in no way physical objects.  A free standing illusion spell could disguise one, but Illusion Shell could not be used, for example.  Gates //can// be the subject of Invisibility.</pre>

<pre>[&gt;img[images/races/troll.jpg]]
Trolls are a short-lived race of ugly and stupid humanoids.  They live among the [[Orcs|Orc]] as slaves.  They are tall and slender with a green and brown skin covered in pustules.  Their hair is usually long, matted and black, though some trolls have hair color that is mossy green, orange or dull blue.  They have long pointy noses and sharp teeth. Their eyes appear as dark black, empty sockets sunk deep into their skull.  Rarely do trolls wear more than loincloths or vests.

!Psychology
Trolls are easily the stupidest of the major races.  They are not inherently evil, but are often savage and unpredictable.  All civilizations often view them as monsters and animals.  They lack the wisdom and morals of members of more ‘civilized’ races.

Trolls will eat almost any kind of meat, including the flesh of sentient races.  However, they can survive on cattle and pigs or any other more typical food animal.  They are not above cannibalism, some starving and desperate Trolls even eating their OWN flesh (due to their rapid healing abilities). Due to their instinctive fear and vulnerability to fire, Trolls eat their meat uncooked and prefer it fresh.

They have no language of their own and speak the [[Orc]], [[Human]] or a garbled mixture of the two tongues.  Some have not even learned the art of communication, and are effectively mute.  This is not due to any physical limitations, but simply from not learning the basics of speech.  Their names usually only contain one syllable or are meaningless grunts.

They are a very short-lived race, reaching maturity at the age of three.  They are hermaphroditic, having internal sex organs capable of asexual reproduction.  A baby Troll grows on the back of the adult, falling off when it is the approximate size of a 3 year old [[Human]] child.  It is capable of walking and eating solid foods.  It is unknown as to the trigger of this reproduction method, but due to these strange methods Troll populations can grow exponentially.

!Culture
Trolls have no real culture or language of their own.  Trolls are slaves, and considered the property of the [[Orcish Tribes]] that bred them, and are branded at birth with the [[tribe’s symbol|Orcish Tribes]] (to aid in reclaiming property).  Trolls are broken up into the following classes: laborers, servants, soldiers, and overseers.  Laborers work the farms and mines.  Servants are assigned to [[Orc Chieftains|Orc Chieftain]], [[shamans|Orc Shaman]] and high-ranking military officers.  Soldiers fill the ranks of the [[Orc]] army as first strike infantry and foot soldiers.  The overseer class is made up of the well-bred and more intelligent Trolls.  They are responsible for the laborers and soldiers who work among the [[Orc]].  Only overseers are given the right to own property in [[Orc]] society, though they are watched closely.  Other Trolls generally fear and are jealous of the overseers.

The [[ancestors of modern Trolls|Third Age Troll]] were solitary predators.  Once born, a baby Troll was left to fend for itself (an easy task with the natural abilities Trolls possess).  Society and Culture are not instinctive traits of the Trolls, but they do understand freedom, and most despise their current subjugation.  Due to their natural tendency to be loners, Trolls do not understand the concept of ‘banding together’, and therefore will most likely remain enslaved by the more organized [[Orcish race|Orc]].

Due to their short life span, Trolls often lack the finer skills indicative of more refined, or ‘educated’ races.  This makes Trolls appear to be childlike and simple.  Trolls spend little time on art or beauty, and spend what little time they have on this world on skills that can aid in survival or procreation.

!Politics
On occasion, the [[Kombar'Ran|Dwarf]] have experimented with Troll labor forces.  Trolls make excellent workman in the mines due to their strength and natural digging abilities.  However, most of these experiments end in failure.  Often too many [[Kombar'Ran|Dwarf]] lose their lives to an out of control Troll blunder, or the [[Dwarven strongholds|Stronghold]] have become overrun with baby Trolls.

Trolls have no government, but instead are governed by the [[Orc]].  Most other races do not view the Trolls as necessarily ‘evil’.  Their ties to the [[Orc]] is often seen as unfortunate, but they are usually seen as unwilling slaves or servants.  The other races have a disdain for Trolls simply on the grounds that they are usually the cause of extreme damage or trouble.  Even Trolls with good intentions inadvertently find ways of causing a ruckus, since they forget how fragile other races truly are.</pre>

Tromokratis is a [[Primordial]] titan from the [[Elemental Planes|The Fountains Of Creation]] living on [[Asha]].  It can be found at the depths of the ocean near the continent of [[Amon]] in a location known as [[The Sailor's Grave]] within [[The Risen Reef]].  Tromokratis slumbers for long periods, making him a myth and legend.  It requires this sleep in order to retain its tether to [[The Material Plane]], waking only to feed on what passes by its terrible maw.

If Tromokratis takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, Tromokratis must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of Tromokratis.

<pre>[&gt;img[images/characters/Athenaeum/ulan-nailo.jpg]]
Ulan Nailo was a player character run by [[Tyler Disbrow]]

Ulan Nailo was originally born a [[Human]] in 978 [[AAP]], and was adopted by [[Mathius Vespian]] (Book Warden of [[The Athenaeum]]) as a baby.  [[Mathius|Mathius Vespian]] is tight lipped about the means he came upon a baby, and many rumors abound as to the origin.  It was [[Winterscrest]] when he returned with the child.  He named him [[Gydas|Gydas Vespian]] after a [[Kellish|Kell]] folk-tale of a warrior king who is celebrated during [[Winterscrest]].  As [[Gydas|Gydas Vespian]] grew, it became obvious that he had little talent for [[Magic]] and possessed no physicality for athletics.  He was clumsy and oafish due to a twisted spine that caused him to walk with a limped hunch.  Since activity was difficult for him, [[Gydas|Gydas Vespian]] took to the books in the library he grew up in.  At a young age he helped [[Mathius Vespian]] maintain the library of [[The Athenaeum]] and soon took on the role of [[Keeper Of The Books]].  He served in this role for over 30 years, and his envy for the [[Wizard]] students continued to grow.  At the age of 43 in the year 1021 [[AAP]], [[Gydas|Gydas Vespian]] ventured into [[The Restricted Section Of The Athenaeum Library]].  There he poured through ancient tomes of power, and stumbled upon a book of rituals.  Inadvertently summoning an [[Imp]], he found himself being beguiled into a contract that granted him a new body and new lease on life at the cost of releasing a [[Dathairä]] trapped under the school.

Transformed into a youthful [[Half-Elf]], he took the name Ulan Nailo and enrolled as a student in [[The Athenaeum]] in 1021 [[AAP]].  He chose this name as it came to him when he awoke within the new body; whether it was fate or his own concoction he may never know.  In school, he met [[Alana Underwood]] and [[Tsoofe]]; fellow students within the same Advisory group under [[Professor]] [[Thog Stoneheart]].

Ulan is fascinated by literature.  He is skilled at research and has learned spellcraft that allows him to read more efficiently.  Ulan enjoys learning, and seeks knowledge no matter how dangerous.  His current obsession is knowledge of [[The First Age]].  He believes there is lost knowledge that could better society as a whole.  Many believe Ulan to be naive, however he is simply more generous than all others; he has been known to give everything he owns to those he believes need it more than him.

While on a field trip with [[Professor]] [[Barnabus Diggle]] in [[The Boneyard]], he stumbled upon a [[Hag]] whom he bargained with.  He traded a piece of his luck for an ancient and powerful artifact known as [[The Dawn Shroud]].  Since then, Ulan has found that he has been lessened in some way; and switched his major to [[Divination]] to not only help unlock the secret of [[The First Age]], but to uncover what it was he lost.  Most are drawn to [[Divination]] for a desire to see the future, Ulan seeks to learn about the hidden past.

[[Ulan's Familiar|Ulan Nailo's Familiar]] came to him as a black cat that he named [[Pearl|Ulan Nailo's Familiar]].  While many [[Wizards|Wizard]] like to keep their [[Familiar]] in the form it arrived (as it prefers this state), Ulan is not one to shy away from transforming [[Pearl|Ulan Nailo's Familiar]] into many forms.</pre>

|![[Click Here For Information on Uskaran Language|Uskaran]]|

The Uskardeen are a race of [[Humans|Human]] that settled and thrived in the civilization of [[Uskard]].  Thousands of years ago, [[The Destruction Of Uskard]] found refuges clinging to makeshift rafts and sailing to [[Kellos]].  The Uskardeen culture is heavily rooted in [[Magic]].  Their skin is darker than the [[Kell]] or [[Amoni|The Amoni People]].

<pre>[&gt;img[images/darkones/vaecna.jpg]]

Vaecna was a [[Dathairä]] that served as a veteran in [[Azarad-Ji's|Azarad-Ji]] army.  Upon being awoken in [[The Second Age]], he fought again for his master.  When [[The Divine Gate]] was sealed, Vaecna grew bored.  While his kin were content to fight for position and control of [[Baator]], Vaecna set his sights on [[Asha]].  He was the first to recognize that the foolish [[Humans|Human]] were the catalyst that freed him and his kind from their prison - and could potentially be used to do it again.

In [[The Third Age]] he was entertained by the fleeting mortality of [[Humans|Human]].  Unlike the other animals of the planet, these [[Human]] organisms spread like a disease across [[Asha]] - felling forests, stripping minerals, and destroying each other.  They had a hunger for power, yet no connection or understanding to [[The Eternal Cycle]].  No other [[Dathairä]] paid them any mind, however Vaecna toyed with them, taking pleasure in their ignorance.  He dissected them, studied them, lived among them, and made a science of understanding their pain.

His final plaything was [[Ammenon]], a [[Human]] slave filled with two of Vaecna's favorite ingredients: rage and desperation.  This victim desired revenge, and Vaecna delivered.  Vaecna was convinced that he could use [[Ammenon]] to bring about [[Desecration]], earning him favor with [[Azarad-Ji]].  He continued to corrupt [[Ammenon]], and provide him with more power as the darkness grew within him.

[[Ammenon]] continued to prove himself to be a potential source for [[Desecration]], as he took to [[Blood Magic]] naturally.  Unbeknownst to Vaecna, [[Ammenon]] twisted and developed new forms of rituals that suited his needs.  It was these magics that [[Ammenon]] used to trap Vaecna.  It was at this moment the [[Dathairä]] first felt fear, as he was clearly outwitted and outmatched by a mortal.  Now Vaecna was the toy, as [[Ammenon]] used the training that Vaecna provided to dissect, study, and torment him - until he finished by butchering Vaecna for parts.</pre>

VanwaHeru (in [[Elvish]] &quot;The Forgotten Prince&quot;) is an [[Archfey]] from [[The Feywild]] who was long ago imprisoned by [[The Court Of Stars]].  His acts were so vile that his captors erased their own memory of him, his deeds, and his location - offering him no hope for being found.  Although VanwaHeru himself is not aware of his whereabouts, he has complete control over his apparently malleable world and alters its appearance into a richly appointed suite.  He has lost track of time, and finds his solitude maddening.  He is powerful, but in an effortless way.  He is vain, but generous; cruel, but helpful.  He will do anything to get what he desires; even subordinate himself to mortals.

Unbeknownst to VanwaHeru, he is trapped within a pocket of [[Sene'Rine'Rada]], the dream world.  On rare occasion, he has noticed a flaw in his prison - brief glimpses of beings who have obliviously stumbled into his domain due to their careless dreaming.  He desperately attempts to ensnare these travelers, and take advantage of their confusion with his charm.  Unfortunately, many of these dreamers fade quickly and slip through his grasp.  Those he is able to communicate with, he is able to gift power - allowing them to return.  He is a [[Warlock Patron]] that seduces with power, reminding his charges that he is their loyal servant; even though he holds all of the power.

Loyalty means everything to VanwaHeru, for he was once betrayed - and seeks to return to [[The Feywild]] and once again claim his throne as the ruler of [[The Court Of Stars]].  He prides himself that he is incapable of lying, and is truthful when he claims to be serving those he gives power; as long as it serves his purposes.

While memories in [[The Feywild]] have been erased, VanwaHeru's have not.  He remembers clearly being overthrown by his subjects, and their lack of loyalty.  [[Lady Calacira]] ruled [[The Dawn Court]] and was the [[Archfey]] who held most of his ire.  It was her who organized his subjects against him, and he took delight in killing her - an act never been done in [[The Feywild]] before.  While his name has been forgotten, he remembers it clearly; and he waits for the day he can return to [[The Feywild]] and give the denizens there a reason to remember his name: [[SenaCethu]] (&quot;The Silver Star&quot; in [[Elvish]]).</pre>

<pre>|![[Guide To Roleplaying A Variona'Sha]]|

The Variona’Sha (rough translation: Sacred Guards who Atone) are a nomadic race of honorable, warrior [[Elves|Elf]] who descend from the legendary group of warriors known as the [[Varigellë|Varigelle]] (translation: Honor the Holy One) who guarded the [[Forana'loloKashira]] during their flight from [[The Sylvan Empire]] in [[The Third Age]].  The Variona’Sha never wavered from the tradition their ancestors began with their vigil over their [[forest brothers|Forana'loloKashira]].  Though time has passed and [[The Eternal Cycle]] flows, the Variona'Sha continue keeping the [[Varigellë Code Of Honor]] as their highest law and central tenant.

They are talll, slender humanoids (determine height normally and add 3”). They grow hair only on their heads, and wear their hair long, sometimes braided.  Variona’Sha have a skin tone that ranges from metallic bronze to a shiny gold, which earns them the nickname ‘Bronze Elves’.  Most Variona’Sha decorate their bodies with piercing (ears, nose, and navels).  They are also fond of tattoos, decorative headbands, and other hair ornaments.  Sometimes they even dye their hair to match their [[clan|Variona'Sha Clans]] colors. Clothing is usually made of leathers and cloth, displaying symbols of their [[clan|Variona'Sha Clans]].

!War Wrought and Battle Tested
The Variona’Sha are drastically opposite of their forest dwelling kin the [[Forana'loloKashira]].  Where the [[Wood Elves|Forana'loloKashira]] are gentle and peaceful, the Variona’Sha are savage and warlike.  Their forest cousins have no real law and live only to love.  The Variona’Sha have strict [[codes of honor and conduct|Varigellë Code Of Honor]]. Throughout [[human history|Timeline]], many great stories have been told about the Bronze Elves and their noble deeds, the heroes who triumphed over evil.  They are skilled fighters, like their [[Varigellë]] ancestors - and many still use weapons from [[The Sylvan Empire]] such as the [[Kahedafa]] &quot;dancing sword&quot; and the [[Naginata]].  Two fighting styles unique to the Variona'Sha are [[Shao'loloSikili]] &quot;The Way Of The Knife&quot;, and [[Kaethu]] &quot;Water Dancing&quot;.

!Selfless Defenders
The culture of the Variona’Sha has been defined by a war-wrought history dating back to the [[The Third Age]] and the fall of [[The Sylvan Empire]].  Their origin began with a group of [[Elven|Third Age Elves]] warriors who called themselves the [[Varigellë]].  They were an elite fighting order of men and women who were known to all as the greatest defenders of the ancient empire.  It was the [[Varigellë]] who rallied against the [[corrupted Sylvan Lords|Kiraga]], challenging their law and defending the followers of [[Raime Wesewierë]].  When the true vileness of the [[Kiragä|Kiraga]] was revealed, the [[Varigellë]] fought a battle that lasted through [[The Third Desecration]] and a century beyond.  For years they fought with the [[Kiragä|Kiraga]] and their endless hordes of monsters, thereby giving the [[Elves|Elf]] that heeded the prophecies of [[Raime Wesewierë]] a chance to flee the cities.

!Restless Wanderers
When the [[Kiragä|Kiraga]] had been forced into hiding and the [[Orc]] pushed back into [[Orcish Lands]], many thousands were dead.  But those [[Varigellë]] that survived had no kingdom to return to.  Some did go to the [[Havens]] and joined the [[Elves|Third Age Elves]] that became the [[Forana'loloKashira]].  However, most found no comfort in the carefree woodland dwellings, finding that war was all they remembered.  The restless ones gathered together in the plains and formed the first [[clan|Variona'Sha Clans]] of the Variona’Sha (roughly translating to ‘Sacred Guards’).  This [[clan|Variona'Sha Clans]] grew and continued keeping the [[Varigellë Code Of Honor]] as their highest law.  The clan split and their culture spread throughout the realm.

!The Clan Above All Else
The Variona’Sha live in groups they refer to as [[clans|Variona'Sha Clans]].  Each clan has an animal totem that they revere as sacred.  Each clan has a [[Chief|Variona'Sha Chief]] and a [[Shaman|Variona'Sha Shaman]].  Shaman’s are sacred and honored within Variona’Sha culture, and are practitioners of [[Druidic|Druid]] [[Nature Magic]].  It is forbidden for a Variona’Sha clan to make war against another clan.  Due to the very low numbers of [[Elves|Elf]], it is taboo to kill fellow [[Elves|Elf]].  In place of clan wars, there exists the [[Melaniacha'hogga]].  Every year, this tournament combat determines what tribe’s chieftain becomes [[chief of chiefs|Chief Of Chiefs]], and may lead all clans.  Challenges and squabbles are also settled with impromptu tournaments.  While outright war is never encountered between two clans, there are often bitter relations between two clans with conflicting ideals or past grievances.  Bronze Elves relate wisdom with age, and the clan elders are well respected for their advice and council.  While the chief has final say over the affairs of the tribe, he often will consult with the elders, and with the [[Shamans|Variona'Sha Shaman]].

!The Face Of Elven Society
The Variona’Sha are the face of the [[Elves|Elf]] in [[Kellos]].  It is the Variona’Sha that have ties to the [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] and [[Human]] empires, not the [[Forana'loloKashira]].  The Variona’Sha then in turn can be considered the middle-man between the [[Forana'loloKashira]] and the rest of the world.  This is one of the many forms in which the Bronze Elves protect their forest brethren.  Most [[clans|Variona'Sha Clans]] live to the far east, and have little contact with the western civilizations.  Their attachment to the eastern lands is due to the strong presence of [[Orcs|Orc]] there, which they are in constant warfare with.

Waywill (76 [[IO]] to 16 [[AAP]]) was known to many of his time as &quot;The Lifehealer&quot;.  He is considered to be one of the most outstanding figures in the history of [[Magic]].  Historians agree that Waywill was born on the frontier of what is now known as [[The Green Sea]], and had contact with the [[Forana'loloKashira]].  Skilled in [[Wizardry]], he learned to master the secrets of [[Druidic]] [[Magic]] by the [[Elf]] scholars who named him [[Malthuelfe]] in their language meaning &quot;Elf Friend&quot;.

He is renowned for founding a school in the [[Human]] territories dedicated to teaching the ways of leveraging [[Magic]] to diagnose, discover and treat of disease.  Waywill was fascinated with the differences between [[Magic]] and [[Divine Favor]], and dedicated much of his research to understanding, comparing and contrasting the two powers.

It is said that it was [[Fazar]] who called for Waywill and his healers to assist in fighting [[The Holy Scourge]] and curing [[The Demon Plague]].  After studying the effects of the plague, it quickly became clear that it was magical in nature.  Waywill and his students went to work cleansing the minds, bodies and souls of those effected.  The combined efforts of [[Mysara]], [[Armondax]], [[Fazar]], and Waywill saw [[The Holy Scourge]] defeated.  During the ensuing war and chaos, [[Cyril Viridian]] overthrew the government and installed himself as [[Emperor]].  [[Cyril Viridian]] saw [[Magic]] as the root of all problems and declared [[Azutan Nagyos]] (translated to &quot;war of the mages&quot; in [[The Old Tongue]]).  A disgust for [[Magic]] had permeated the land and the four wizards formed what is now known as [[The Grand Fellowship Of Mages]].

After years of fighting, the [[Azutan Nagyos]] was lifted, and magic was no longer outlawed.  It is not documented why the war ended, however [[Cyril Viridian]] saw to the foundation of [[The Magian Imperium]] to govern the use of magic throughout [[The Viridian Empire]].

Wentus Onemead has held the position of [[Archbishop]] in the city of [[Laranor]] for 15 years.  He is a very fanatical believer in [[The Divine Order]], and has devoted his life to spreading the word.  While he means well, his unwillingness to waiver and listen to any opinion other than his own has caused trouble in the past.  It was under his care in which one of his priests named [[Gavar Joro]] was murdered, causing a deep following known forever more as [[The Followers Of Joro]].</pre>

<pre>White Robes are the magistrates who interpret law in [[The Waste]].  When called upon, they deliver an on the spot verdict based upon the evidence they have before them.  They are the absolute authority at interpreting law, and can only be appealed by [[The Akabele-ethu Lord's Court]].  While any citizen can call upon the service of a White Robe, it is typically one of the [[Sashes]] that provides the White Robes with the information needed to come to a just and fair ruling.

!Advantages &amp; Disadvantages
Magistrates have the advantages of Legal Enforcement Powers (10 points). They have the prerequisites of: Interrogation 14+, Detect Lies 12+, Law:Akabele-ethu 16+.
It costs 10 points to play a Magistrate.</pre>

<div title="Wizardry" creator="Brian Disbrow" modifier="Brian Disbrow" created="202006141530" modified="202012261412" changecount="21">
<pre>Wizards are users of [[Magic]] that through scholarly study can use the weave of [[Mana]] to manipulate the world.  Wizards treat [[Magic]] like a science, and require an [[Arcane Focus]] to cast spells.  Some seek to unlock the secrets of the universe, while others are lured by knowledge and research.  This learning requires years of study and practice to cultivate; honing one's Wizardry requires learning the right combinations of incantations and rituals.  Anyone is capable of Wizardry given the right amount of time and study.

!Spell Book
Every arcane spell has a written version, recorded in a [[Spell Book]].  Wizards use a detailed [[Spell Book]] to document their knowledge and study it every morning to commit to memory the spells they have prepared for that day.  A single spell can take up multiple pages of the [[Spell Book]], with most spellbooks being over one hundred pages long.

!Arcane Focus
Unlike [[Sorcerers|Sorcery]], Wizards require an [[Arcane Focus]] to cast their spells.  This is either a pouch containing the needed materials and components to cast the desired spells; or an object imbued as a Wizards [[Arcane Focus]] such as a wand, orb or staff.

!Arcane Schools
[[Abjuration]], [[Alkemancy]], [[Conjuration]], [[Divination]], [[Enchantment]], [[Evocation]], [[Glamour]], [[Illusion]], [[Meta]], [[Transmutation]], [[Traveling]], [[Summoning]]

!Familiars
[[Familiars|Familiar]] are Wizardly companions that are summoned into the body of an animal.  A wizard has a bond with their [[Familiar]]; they have the ability to communicate telepathically and can use their senses, as well as cast some spells through them.  [[Familiars|Familiar]] are spirits from [[The Shadow Lands]] or [[The Feywild]], yet they arrive in the form of a common animal such as a Toad, Cat, or Ferret.  In rare occasions, the spirit arrives in its natural form of a creature from [[The Feywild]] or [[The Shadow Lands]].  It is possible to use [[Magic]] to alter the form of the [[Familiar]], but it's natural state is that of what it arrives in when the Wizard first summons them.

!Wizards In Society
The foremost center of Wizardry knowledge and study is [[The Athenaeum]] in the city of [[Zylok]] located on the continent of [[Kellos]].</pre>

|IQ: 6|Damage: *|Habitat: Mountain|
|HT: 14/24-30|&gt;|Reach: C,1,2|
|&gt;|&gt;|* Tail barb is 1d+2 imp, Talons 1d-1 cut, Bite 1d+1 imp|

Wyverns are distantly related to [[Dragons|Dragon]], however only have hind legs and possess a barbed poisonous tail.  On land they crawl on their wing tips and are reduced to a speed of 3 and dodge of 7.  They are solitary creatures typically found within tangled forest, great caverns, and the like.  They are rather stupid, but very aggressive, and wyverns will always attack.  Wyverns have scales that range from drab brown to black, and have four eyes on their head that are often red, orage or green.

A wyvern will strike with its tail (2 hex reach), often from the air, and then land to carry off its prey;  it can carry up to Medium encumbrance.  Its barbed tail can penetrate up to heavy leather armor or chainmail , but nothing thicker.  Against a metal armored foe, a wyvern is faily helpless, though it will slam-attack an armored opponent to get to less armored prey.  

The tails venom is very strong.  Anyone stung must make a roll against HT-6.  Failure means the venom does 2d damage in addition to any damage done by the barb, and the victim is at -4 DX for the next three days - critical failure means instant death.  If the HT-6 roll is made, the victim takes only half damage (in addition to the damage done by the barb), and is at -2 DX for the next three days.  The wyvern can strike up to 20 times before exhausting its venom, and takes about 8 hours to replace each dose used.

He seeks to bring about [[Desecration]], and nearly succeeded at ending [[The Fourth Age]] along with [[Teldinath Dagon]] during what is known as [[The Demon Plague]].
Zezebazum has a monstrous appearance, simply looking at his natural form will cause a fright check with a penalty of –5.  He also has the ability to transform himself to look like any living creature he has seen for up to 2d hours.  He uses this power to appear harmless while preaching the word of his wicked master [[Azarad-Ji]].  He is patient, cunning, and a master deceiver.  He first attempts to beguile before resulting to brute force and aggression.

|Population:|30,000.  70% [[Human]] and 30% [[Dwarf]] (at last census)|
|Fortifications:|Magically fortified stone walls (essential Earth).|
|Law:|Zylok trains wizards for warfare and defense.  Their militia, known as [[The Zylokian Magus]] also functions as a city guard.  All officers are wizards.  There are about 1200 men in the militia.  In times of war they can muster 5000+.  Only licensed wizards may perform magic within the city walls.  Felonious magicians will be fined or imprisoned depending on the severity of their magic use.|
|Resources:|Zylok is known as a city of knowledge.  Therefore the city is a leading manufacturer of ink (both fine and ordinary) and paper products.  Little food is grown locally and nearly all consumables are imported from nearby cities and settlements.|

!Description
This colorful city was originally founded by a community of [[mages|Magic]] wishing to seek peace from the non-magic peoples of the mainland.  In those days magic was considered taboo, and was often looked upon fearfully.  The city has now grown into the largest city on [[The Isles]].  Boasting a large seaport, and strong walls, it is built in the rocky terrain in the shadow of the mountains.

Zylok has a bustling seaport where ships from the continents of [[Uskard]] and [[Amon]] dock and trade goods.  The city is built on rolling hills, with a thick wall surrounding the city made of glimmering shiny black obsidian.  Being a city founded by [[Wizards|Wizardry]], [[Magic]] is seen everywhere.  Topiary bushes of various animals (lions, bears, dragons and rabbits) adorn public buildings, all moving very imperceptibly and subtly and slowly such that their poses change throughout the day.  Those living in the city are grow accustomed to flashes and bursts of magical light emanating from [[Fort Adept]].  Street performers use magic to delight passerby - using illusion to create shapes and animals in thin air.

The buildings of the city are tightly arranged, with roofs made of a colorful array of ceramic tile.  Zylok boasts an [[Airship]] tower near the center of the city, reaching high into the sky.

The city is organized into the following districts
* __The Dock Ward__ - a run down seedy part of town.  Tall densely packed tenements leave most of the neighborhood in shadow at ground level.  Most of the streetlamps have had their glass smashed, and the smells of salt air and excrement lingers within the rows of run-down buildings.  This is the location of [[The Dragon’s Roost]].
* __The Candlekeep District__ - a quiet section of the city with quaint shops and three story brownstone homes.  This is the location of [[The Emporium Arcana]], as well as a crossroads known as Scholar's Square.
* __The Garden District__ - is where many noble families make their residence.  It is named for the many flowers, grass, and trees kept in the small lawns and gardens of the nobles.  [[Fenwick Vandergeist]] makes his home here.
* __The Station District__ - is where you will find [[The Zylokian Waystation]], in the southern section of the city.  This district is on the highest hill that the city was built upon and offers the best view of the city.


!Social Customs
* A large celebration is performed to celebrate the birthday of the [[Archmage]].  The grandness of the event is usually representation of the popularity of the [[Archmage]].

!Notable Characters
| [img[images/characters/Notable People/The Isles/Zylok/eustacia-vaisanan-portrait.jpg][Eustacia Vaisanan]] [[Eustacia Vaisanan]] |__[[Eustacia Vaisanan]]__ is a pragmatic and presiding [[Shield]] of Zylok, [[Marshall]] of [[The Isles]] and head of [[House Vaisanan]].  She is a very keen negotiator even at the tender age of 22.  Her strong social skills give her a very high rapport with the populace.  [[Eustacia Vaisanan]] is the youngest [[Archmage]] in the city’s history.  She is incredibly powerful, and is considered a child prodigy in every respect.  She was trained and mentored by [[Fallim Haring]]. |
| [img[images/characters/Notable People/The Isles/Zylok/fallim-haring-portrait.jpg][Fallim Haring]] [[Fallim Haring]] |__[[Fallim Haring]]__ was first appointed to the council by the [[Archmage]] [[Geblin Vaisanan]] and advised him through twenty prosperous years.  He served again as council to the [[Archmage]] [[Moll Vaisanan]], until his untimely death five years after his appointment.  Yet again [[Eustacia Vaisanan]], who at one time was his apprentice, called for his aid.  [[Fallim Haring]] is an excellent teacher and mentor, yet rarely takes on a student.  He only picks pupils that show great promise.  [[Fallim Haring]] has taught [[Eustacia Vaisanan]] everything that he knows and she has soaked in all of his knowledge.  Now he aids her with his wise council and experience.  She has surpassed all of his expectations, and now considers her an equal by all accounts.|
| [img[images/characters/Notable People/The Isles/Zylok/eblom-mallis-portrait.jpg][Eblom Mallis]] [[Eblom Mallis]] |__[[Eblom Mallis]]__ is a former high-ranking military officer.  [[Eustacia Vaisanan]] appointed him to her council.  He feels that he was pressured into the position and would much rather have remained in the military.  He is angry and dour, resenting [[Eustacia Vaisanan]] and the council as a whole.  While he may be mean and nasty, deep down he would die for Zylok (a patriot’s patriot).  He simply feels his skills would be better served as a military man. |
| [img[images/characters/Notable People/The Isles/Zylok/ismo-godal-portrait.jpg][Ismo Godal]] [[Ismo Godal]] |__[[Ismo Godal]]__ was a swindler and pirate, con man and thief.  He was captured within the walls of Zylok, ending his underworld career forever.  [[Eustacia Vaisanan]] convinced him to help her and ever since he has been devoutly loyal to her.  He never breaks his word and promised to serve Zylok in exchange for his life.  He has now found a purpose and a change of heart.  The city guard (who had been trying to nab him for years) thought it extremely easy to catch him.  Those who know him well think he had simply become disenchanted by his former roguish lifestyle.  He is fond of saying ‘There is no honor among thieves nowadays’, and is known to go on and on about ‘the good old days’.  He is now the best of friends with his former rival [[Reeve]] [[Kirk Dow]].  The [[Reeve]] had always seen the honor and potential in [[Ismo Godal]], and is now proud to have him on Zylok's side.|
| [img[images/characters/Notable People/The Isles/Zylok/duncan-stoneheart-portrait.jpg][Duncan Stoneheart]] [[Duncan Stoneheart]] |__[[Duncan Stoneheart]]__ is a [[Dwarven|Dwarf]] [[Volg'gogan]] (or priest) of [[The Undermountain Papacy]] from the [[Stronghold]] of [[Avorbarath]].  He is a stubborn but gentle soul.  He always shows a gruff and harsh exterior, but despite appearances he is kind and caring.  He has a large soft spot for [[Eustacia Vaisanan]].  He is the first [[Dwarf]] to be appointed into the council.  [[The Undermountain Papacy]] sees this as an excellent connection to human bureaucracy.  The choice of [[Duncan Stoneheart]] for council was a stroke of political genius on the part of [[Eustacia Vaisanan]], as it gave the [[Dwarf]] people a voice in the local government and therefore increased their support for her.  The [[Dwarf]] no longer consider themselves foreigners within the city walls and now truly call Zylok their home.|
| [img[images/characters/Notable People/The Isles/Zylok/kirk-dow-portrait.jpg][Kirk Dow]] [[Kirk Dow]] |__[[Kirk Dow]]__ is a respected and charismatic leader.  He is the [[Reeve]] of Zylok and in full command of Zylok’s military forces.  The [[Reeve]] follows the orders of the [[Archmage]], but is always consulted in military matters.  He is kind and fair, yet gruff and stern to those who appear to be up to no good.  He is best of friends with the nefarious [[Ismo Godal]].|
| [img[images/characters/Notable People/The Isles/Zylok/fenwick-vendergeist-portrait.jpg][Fenwick Vendergeist]] [[Fenwick Vendergeist]] |__[[Fenwick Vendergeist]]__ is a very eccentric, reclusive, elderly [[Half-Elf]] [[Wizard]] that has a tower within the city.  He specializes in [[Transmutation]] [[Magic]] and [[Alchemy]], his very tower seems to grow larger as you approach.  He is good friends with [[Barnabus Diggle]].|
